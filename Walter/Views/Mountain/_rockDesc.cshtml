        My first introduction to the sport of Rock Climbing was in 1981.  To be precise I didn’t actually climb but I learned to rappel and as such I was introduced to ropes, setting up anchors, using harnesses, etc.  I was a member of the Ventures scouting  program of the fifth Ward in Cardston, Alberta.  Our leader was George Toone, who must have been in his twenties at the time.
        At least twice, if not more times, George took us to this sizeable dirt (or perhaps sandstone) cliff on Gregson’s land.  He’d set up a
        redundant anchor by slinging a big rock with some webbing and then backing it up with some webbing around a tree; to both pieces of webbing he’d
        attached the rope and position it over the cliff.  Out of webbing he’d tie a harness for whoevers turn it was to abseil.  I’m sure he gave
        us detailed instructions, but that part I don’t remember, also I don’t recall using a fireman’s belay.  Nevertheless no one got hurt so
        George must have been a good teacher and safety conscious as well.  I remember rappelling with no concerns, and even trying to get down in
        just a couple of jumps.  We must have used a figure eight to have been able to get down as rapidly as we did.  I was so confident with rappelling
        that George even had me go head first commando style!
    </p>
    <p>Those rappelling experiences must have planted a rock climbing seed in me, because in 1986 during my second semester at college I attempted to sign up for a spring rock climbing class. Pre-registration was full but I suggested to my friend Sean Skelton that we attend the first day and see if we could get in.  It was all my idea and Sean just tagged along, as such, imagine my disappointment when Sean won the name drawing getting him into the class, while I didn’t. </p>
    <p> I’m not sure if this was 1986 or sometime later, but Sean borrowed a rope, harnesses, etc., and he and I went up to Rock Canyon in Provo and set up a top-rope and climbed.  I want to say we climbed at Red Slab but most likely it was the Kitchen, as in those days you could drive right to it.  I remember feeling nervous, not because of the height, or anything to do with the climb, but because I noticed Sean wasn’t paying attention while belaying me.  That was a negative experience, and I believe it sidetracked me, for the moment, from my interest in rock climbing.</p>
    <p>The summer of 1993 rock climbing found me again.  In Cardston Cliff Smith, Jon Strong and friends had attached a few holds to one of the walls of the old Fern’s Chocolates building.  Although I climbed it just a couple of times, I remember really liking it, and I thought it was so cool.</p>
    <p>In October of 1993 a group of us, including Jon Strong, Becky Hatch, Karen Broadhead, Darrell Scott, Cliff Smith, Corey McCarthy, and Duane Beazer took a trip to Stone Hill MT. I don’t know the names or rating of the climbs we did, but most of the climbs were right next to the road, and at one point I cranked up the cassette player in my Isuzu Rodeo and blasted out “Cocaine” by Eric Clapton, much to the liking of Duane Beazer.  I also recall a climb on the west side of the road that over looked a body of water.  On that trip I had a deep cut on my right pointer finger as a result of catching it in the car door just a few days prior.</p>
    <p>Also I did a day trip, another time, to Stone Hill, MT with Duane Beazer and Jon Strong. Duane drove his BMW. I don’t recollect if anyone else came with us or what we climbed but I remember leaving very early in the morning and filling up with gas in the Crowsnest pass. That could have also been the autumn of 1993 or perhaps it was the spring of 1994.</p>
    <p>The summer of 1994 I spent in Edmonton Alberta.  Duane Beazer was also living there, and he had discovered a bridge with a stone support wall at one end that folks climbed on.  We gave it a try one day, and for some unknown reason we tied the rope to the bumper of my Rodeo.  Another time that summer I was in Waterton and a few acquaintances had a top-rope set up on a cliff below Bears Hump; Kyle Heniger let me use his harness and shoes and I climbed it.</p>
    <p>From Edmonton a few years went by before I did any climbing again. Then in 1998 a fellow named Mat befriended me at the Langley Ward in Northern Virginia and invited me to go to a climbing gym with him in Alexandria.  On March 22, 1998 I wrote in my journal “Last Saturday, I went indoor climbing at Sport-Rock with Mat (a guy I met at Church).  Thursday we went again and this time his fiancée Kimberly came along. Now I want to get my own equipment and join the gym”.  Clearly I really enjoyed it, and also I felt like it was something I could be good at, but I didn’t end up buying the gear or joining the gym.</p>
    <p>With just that limited background, and not even owning any gear, I to some extent thought that I was a climber, even though I never went climbing again for at least two or three more years.  The next opportunity presented itself when Colin Gibb, a friend of my buddy Eric Parker, announced one day that he had a rope and other climbing gear, and he wanted to go climb on the Virginia side of the Potomac River across from Carter Rock, Maryland.  I was eager to go.  If memory serves, Colin and I rappelled down a vertical, stone, river bank, while our friends Eric, Yolanda, Yenny, and Shalin (Colin’s fiancée) waited at the top. We climbed out, and that was that!  A very basic outing, but once again it enticed my appetite for the sport to the point where I again considered buying the necessary gear.  However a little research on climbing opportunities in the DC area changed that when I learned that like most things in DC they were often over-crowded.  Colin and Shalin married June 29, 2001, so if I had to guess I’d say the Potomac climbing experience was most likely that same summer.</p>
    <p>In 2005 I moved to Utah, and soon after started climbing a lot of mountains via hiking and scrambling.  I thought about getting into rock climbing, but was content, and busy with, the mountaineering skills I was learning doing non-technical peak- bagging.  It might seem odd but I also refrained from rock climbing, during my first few years in Utah as I didn’t see it as much of an aerobic sport, and since I was pursuing mountaineering I want to stay aerobically fit.</p>
    <p>A few more years went by when in the spring 2009 while driving back to Utah from a climbing/skiing trip to Mt. Shasta, CA Mark Borges asked me if I rock climbed.   I guess to some extent I still thought of myself as a climber and so I said that I did, but qualified it by adding that I needed to get a harness.  He invited me to go climb in Little Cottonwood Canyon with him, and even followed up the invitation later with an email.  I wanted to go, and I think I even planned on it, but in the end I let the opportunity slip by.  Then in August 2009 while I was on a Gannet Peak trip in Wyoming Jans Wager watered that rock climbing seed in me, when she informed me that I really should get into rock climbing as it would make me a more well-rounded mountaineer.</p>
    <p>The seed found a way to finally grow when in 2010 the right opportunity came along.   It came as a result of my desire to climb Mt. Rainer in Washington.  Without luck, since the end of 2009, I had been trying to find partners for a summer 2010 trip to Mt. Rainer when in early January 2010, while driving home from a Saturday ski tour to Gobblers Knob, Matt Jesperson told me about the Utah Climbing Club.  He said the club was scheduled to do Rainer that year and he suggested I join them.  He also informed me that the leaders of the club were, in his words “world class rock climbers” and that through them I could really learn how to rock climb.  I was so convinced that I went directly to Mountain Works in Provo,  upon are return to Utah County, and signed up for the club.</p>
    <p>My first event with the club was Ice Climbing in Maple Canyon January 31, 2010 – which was so amazing to me, and which I seemed to do very well at.  Doug Stout, the guy who took me under his wing at the event, commented that I didn’t seem like a first timer.  I top-roped seven routes that day namely Rubber Cup Nausea, Moroni Turkey Plant, Arch (not real name), Lemon, Running Man, Road Side Coulior, and Under Wraps.  I remember being disappointed that I didn’t have time to climb Cobble Cruncher.</p>
    <p>A benefit of being in the UCC was that we were allowed to use the local climbing gym, named The Quarry, for free for the month of February.   As such on February 1, 2010 I purchased a rope, GriGri, shoes, and four quickdraws. For the ice climbing event I had acquired a harness, helmet, locking karabiner, and an ATC.  Finally, approximately twenty-nine years since my introduction to climbing I had my own gear!</p>
    <p>Armed with the gear I frequented the Quarry two or three times a week during February 2010.  Also during that month the club held lead climbing, and falling clinics. At the lead clinics we learned how to clip quickdraws and lead belaying techniques (like standing close to the wall).  At the falling clinics we were taught to trust the rope, with the thought being that we would then not be afraid to fall, and would push ourselves to climb harder.  I think I learned not to fall as a result of how my controlled fall at the clinic played out.  Christian Knight (one of the world class climbers) had me climb up the lead wall just a few feet above my last quickdraw and then he told me to fall.  I hesitated giving him time to sneak a lot slack into the line, and so when I “fell”, I fell at least 20 feet.  He thought it was funny but I didn’t.  Bearing that bad experience in mind, I really took to a statement made by Reinhold Messner in which he declared he had never taken a fall climbing.</p>
    <p>In April 2010 the UCC took a trip to Moab, where we climbed at Wall Street.  At that event I was introduced to cams and learned the difference between a slab and a wall.  In June 2010 the UCC learned how to use stoppers during an event at the meat wall in Rock Canyon.  Although cams and stoppers are used for “trad” (traditional) climbing we didn’t in fact trad climbing at these events.</p>
    <p>On July 17, 2010 I summited Mt. Rainer with Josh Jones.   A few days prior the two of us also climbed Mt. Hood in Oregon.  In preparation for those two alpine climbs I learned a lot about glacier travel, and crevasse rescue, and in so doing discovered there are a lot of shared practices between alpinism and rock climbing.</p>
    <p>With the Mt. Rainier goal realized time opened up for more rock climbing, and by the first part of August I started climbing fairly regularly with Glenn Merrill at Rock Canyon in Provo, Utah.  On my birthday Glenn introduced me to multi-pitch climbing– I don’t think he realized it was my birthday but what a great present none-the-less.  Although not typically done as a multi-pitch climb, my first multi-pitch was a variation/combo of Curious George, and George.  We ended the climb with another new-to-me practice by simul-rappelling off it. Having caught the multi-pitch bug Glenn later introduced me to the Layer Cakes area on the north side of Rock Canyon.</p>
    <p>I also got out a few times in August and September with Carl Line, a fellow from the UCC.  I picked up a few good tips from him such as hanging my shoes on the outside of my pack so they have a chance to air out, and the importance of looking at ones feet when climbing.  On August 14, I climbed at the Red Wonder Wall in Santaquin Canyon with the UCC, and liked it so much that I returned a couple weeks later with Glenn.</p>
    <p>Over the Labor Day weekend of 2010, Glenn and I took a trip to Idaho and climbed at both the City of Rocks, and Castle Rock.  On this trip I learned how easy it is to get a rope stuck. Probably too late in the afternoon we climbed Cruel Shoes on Stripe Rock where we took the wrong rappel down, in the dark (to boot).  We had two ropes tied together for the rappel and we were able to pull them to the knot, but not beyond, allowing us to retrieve only one of them – leaving my rope stuck.  We had to return the next morning to work out the problem and fortunately we managed to get the rope unstuck. I ended up back at the City of Rocks Sept 10 & 11 due to the cancelation of a UCC event to Devils Tower, WY. This time Jacob Moon and Wayne Pullman joined Glenn and I, and along with a few other routes we climbed a couple of long multi-pitch sports routes namely Theater of Shadows on Jackson’s Thumb, and Sinocranium on Steinfelds Dome.  Glen, Jacob and I also free soloed the Cowboy Route on Bath Rock. At the end of September I climbed in American Fork Canyon at the Hard Rock area with the Adventure Seekers Society (ASS).</p>
    <p>Through the UCC I had been introduced to cams and stoppers but it wasn’t until I joined Glenn, Matt Long, and Matt Jesperson at Red Rock Canyon, NV, October 23, that I truly experienced traditional climbing. On that trip we simul-climbed Solar Slab gully on the lower tier, followed by the Solar Slab route on the upper tier.  That was also my initiation to simul-climbing.</p>
    <p>In summary, rock climbing was something I was interested in for many years but 2010 was the year I actually learned technical climbing. It all started with ice climbing in January followed by gym climbing in February, slab climbing in April, glacier travel in July, multi-pitch climbing in August, and traditional climbing in October.  I owe a lot of thanks to the UCC and to good friends.</p>

    I love to be out doors, and as such I was never very interested in indoor (aka gym) climbing.  But in September 2015, Kenneth Fairchild (a fellow I'd climb just a few times with outside) asked me if I wanted to be his Quarry (gym) partner.  I decided to give it a try.  I climbed with him indoors, typically twice a week, until April 11, 2016 when he resigned his membership.  By then I had really taken a liking to indoor climbing, and so I maintained my membership, and soon found a regular partner in Alan Moore. Alan was very new to the sport, and had no interest in lead climbing, no matter how much I pushed for it and tried to train him for it. So I started also climbing with Mike Hall, but Mike was young and not responsible and quite on me, without notice after about 5 months.  Alan stayed with it until May 15, 2017, and I continued to look for a lead partner, but never found a steady one.  As such I froze my Quarry account in May, 2017 and resigned it a month or two after as I was unable to find a partner.  Then in August 2017 Jeff Rose asked me to join to climb with him, and so I did.  As of August 2018 (one year later) I'm still climbing faithfully, two days a week, at the Quarry with Jeff.  I've noticed this summer, climbing outdoors, that I have improved. I notice to in the winter that I was a lot stronger/confident ice climber too. The only down side to gym climbing is that it is so convenient it means I am less motived now to get outside!
