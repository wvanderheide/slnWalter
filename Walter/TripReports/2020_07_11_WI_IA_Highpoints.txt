July 9, 2020 I flew to Minneapolis then drove north to the trailhead for Eagle Mountain.  Slept in my tent, due to the many mosquitoes, at the trailhead. July 10 – Summited Eagle Mountain, then drove to Mt Arvon MI and summited that. Camped that night in Ottawa NF off Highway 28. July 11, en route to Timm’s Hill WI, drove through Land O Lakes WI.  Next I drove to IA to Hawkeye Point.  Slept in the car that night next to a corn field.  July 12 return to Minneapolis and flew home via Dallas and San Francisco.

15.	When I got home, I noticed how much the mosquitoes got in through the shirt placket opening – one doesn’t easily see that part of his arm so the bugs had a perfect opening and spot to feed on me.
16.	 Day 2 continued on to Mt. Arvon MI.
17.	Day 2 drive from Eagle Mt to Mt. Arvon.
18.	Notice the white sign to the right of the car on the tree, those signs marked the way on the gravel roads to Mt. Arvon once considered extremely difficult to find, but the signs made it easy.
19.	There is a new hiking trail to Mt. Arvon claiming to be 1.75 miles but hiked it in 30 mins so it’s likely shorter than 1.75 miles.  Drive up was an option, but I decided to hike.
