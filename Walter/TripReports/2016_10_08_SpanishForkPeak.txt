8:43 am I left the parking lot, and on the way to the Lake I passed a gray haired guy with three boys,
two older guys,  two ladies with a guy, an older guy with hedge clippers and a young man with a machet, two young men 
one with a shot-gun and the other with a dog, three elk hunters, and going in the down direction two young guys with arrows.

I reached the Maple lake (3.5 miles) at 10:41 am (2 hours).

Between the lake and the saddle I sat down on a rock and had a snack, then as I continued to the saddle I noticed
a tall slender guy gaining on me, so I had to pick up the pace.  I reached the saddle at 11:19 am (2.5 hours), and gained
the East to West ridge at 11:32 am (2 hours 45 mins), and finally the peak at 11:42 am (3 hours).

About 15 mins after my arrival the tall slender guy arrived, and he commented that I was moving fast, indicating to me
that I had wanted to catch up to me as I suspected.  He turned out to be firendly so I was walked down with him and
had an enjoyable conversation.  His name is Donehue, and he's from Upstate NY, went to school at George Town DC and
lives and works in SLC for the last 4 years.

The descent began at 12:09 pm and ended at 2:50 pm.  2 hours 40 mins.
