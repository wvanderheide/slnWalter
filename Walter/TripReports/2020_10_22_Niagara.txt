1.	October 22, 2020 as I was returning from Rhode Island to Columbus Ohio, I stopped at Niagara Falls. Niagara Falls is made up of three distinct falls. From north to south (from the USA to Canada – which is weird to realize part of Canada at the NY/Ontario line is south of the USA) American Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, Horseshoe Falls (aka Canadian Falls) – the big one.
2.	I arrived via the Niagara Parkway and parked for free on the Riverway steet.  Then walked under the two bridges heading west (a little north) to the top of American Falls.  In this photo I am looking west over American Falls, the city seen is Niagara Falls, Ontario.
3.	A SW looking view over the three falls, with Niagara Falls, Ontario on the right.
4.	With the pandemic going on there was no line, and only a small crowd on the Maid of the Mist tour.  Cost $22.25 for the 10 or 15 minute boat ride passing in front of (to the west of) the three falls, while boating up the Niagara River which forms the border of Canada and the US of A. To reach the Horseshoe Falls the boat briefly and barely crosses into Ontario.

Toronto is 70 km, as the crow flies from American Falls, or 144 km to drive. The Niagara River seems to be run off from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.  Buffalo NY is on lake Erie, and Toronto is on Lake Ontario.
