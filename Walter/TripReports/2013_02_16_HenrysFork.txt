Feb 16,2013, Jim Allman and I hooked up with Mike Hylland, Dale Chapman, and Loren Tomasi to ski into Henry's Fork for the weekend. We hoped to move fast enough to make it to Dollar Lake (11 miles in the winter) on day 1, summit Kings peak on day 2, and ski out on day 3. It was aggressive and alas impossible!!! We made it 7 miles in on day one and changed our plan to go for Gilbert Peak instead. Dale and I made it to about 12,200 ft on Gilbert. Mike and Loren went to about 12, 600 ft.
1.	I picked up Jim Allman in Orem at 5:00 am Feb 16, 2013, and we drove to Henry's Fork arriving about 8:20 am. The road was plowed over the ditch and attempting to park I promptly got stuck.
2.	I tried to dig it out before the others arrived, but wasn't able to get out.
3.	 Luckily Loren had a tow rope, and was able to pull it out. Photo by LT.
4.	 Once the truck was unstuck we got ready to tour. Photo my MH.
5.	 By 9:35 am Jim and I set off with the others to follow soon. Photo by LT.

7.	 It took 2 hours to reach the summer trailhead, where we dropped onto the creek and had to put in the trail. It's faster to use the creek in the winter than the trail on the high banks that are often without snow. Photo by LT.
8.	We found the skiers without sleds were better at trailbreaking. Photo by LT.

10.	By 12:45 pm we hooked back on to the summer trail and found it to be packed, much to our liking. We paused for lunch. Photo by LT.
11.	We continued on toward Alligator Lake, enjoying the packed trail. Photo by JA.
12.	By 2:45 pm we were nearing the bridge just before Alligator Lake turn off. Photo by LT.
13.	Just before the bridge (before 3pm) the packed trail left the summer trail and dropped down a steep gully and into the creek bed. Photo by WV.

17.	We ended up camping at the same spot as Jan 2012 trip (about 7.5 miles in, or 1.5 miles shy of Elkhorn crossing). This is where the packed trail ended and we meet Ryan and Melissa who had only been able to cover 2 miles in six hours putting in the trail. Feb 17, 2013, it had been a "warm" night and I was up by 7:00 am with the sun. Photo by WV.
