July 16 & 17, I climbed Washington’s Mt. Rainier with the Utah Climbing Club.  July 16 nine climbers meet at Paradise and hiked the 4.25 miles and 4660 vertical feet to Camp Muir, where I spend four hours melting water, setting up camp, and eating.  Next morning I got up at 1:30 am and was ready to climb the remaining 4.75 miles and 4330 vertical feet by 3:00 am.  Josh Jones and I roped up with the White brothers Tyler and Aaron.  By 3:40 am everyone on our rope was ready to go and we began the ascent.  We followed the Disappointment Cleaver route.  From Camp Muir we traversed the Cowlitz Glacier to Cathedral Gap (10,640 ft) and then continued left along scree, ice and snow to Ingram flats (11,100 ft ) where we encountered our first crevasse.  From Ingram Flats we climbed the Disappointment Cleaver (12,250 ft).  As we ascended the Cleaver we watched the sunrise.  By 6:30 am MST we reached the top of the Cleaver, where we paused to remove our headlamps, and wait for the other five members of our group.  Next we ascended the Ingraham’s  Glacier to the Emmon’s  Glacier which took us to the 14,180 ft crater rim arriving at 9:15 am.  From the rim we walked across the crater to Columbia Crest, the true summit, at 14,410 ft.  We completed the ascent in just under six hours.  It was windy at the high point, so we spent only 10 minutes on the peak and moved lower to pause for a snack.  After 45 minutes of rest we began the descent, arriving back at Camp Muir in  4 hours at 2:30 pm.  At Camp Muir Josh and I melted snow for water, packed up our gear and started down to Paradise at 5 pm arriving in about 2.5 hours.
