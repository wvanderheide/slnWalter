Humphreys Peak - AZ

We were supposed to leave Orem at 9:00 am but it was almost 10:30 by the time we headed south on I-15 from Orem, Wednesday Nov 17, 2010.  We stopped for dinner at Dennys in Page AZ and by 9pm we were at Snowbowl where we camped in the parking lot on a cold night.  I had told Ana to bring a warm sleeping bag and an extra blanket or two, but whatever she had wasn’t warm enough and I ended up giving her my down bag.
Next morning we were up at 5 am, and on the trail at 6:30 am with the sun somewhat up.  The Humphreys’ Peak trail wasn’t obvious so we ended up hiking under one of the ski lifts till we eventually crossed the hiking trail a few hundred yards beyond the end of the lift. We made it to the roof of AZ in 3.5 hours.  I felt that Ana did very well.   This was my 11th US State High Point. We had the summit to ourselves making the views that much easier to enjoy.  We spent 45 or so minutes on the summit before heading down.
I wanted to summit Mt. Agassiz on the way down but on the ascent from the saddle we noticed a sign saying it was closed.  I have no idea why it was closed but the sign seemed serious threatening a $500 fine.  I had been laid off from my job Nov 9, and didn’t like the idea of spending $500 to reach another peak.  
Around 3pm we returned to the car, having covered 11 miles and over 3500 vertical feet.
On the drive down from the ski resort we stopped before Flagstaff and ate dinner on the side of the road, then headed to the Kaibab forest near Jacobs Lake where we found a free spot to camp for the night.
Friday we drove to Escalante Utah and had lunch at Subway.  Following lunch we started down the dirt/gravel Hole-In-The-Rock road en route to Coyote Gulch.  Only 10 miles in and the front left tire region started rattling, and the brakes started to act up.  So we had to turn around and return to Escalante using low gears to slow the car when needed.  We waited for a couple hours for the one and only mechanic in town to look at the car.  He discovered one of the two caliper bolts were missing…
