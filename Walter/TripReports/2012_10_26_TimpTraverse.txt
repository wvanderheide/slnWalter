It had been an extra dry summer in Utah which had reached into Fall as well, so when that first Fall snow storm came I was eager to get into the mountains and enjoy it.  A band of storms passed through the State October 23-25, 2012, and I just happened to have Friday off, so I decided to head up to the mountains. One of the advantages of going hiking in the snow is it tends to drastically lessen the crowd making the outing more adventurous.   

I’d been wanting to hit the four main peaks of Mount Timpanogos, in one push, for several year, and I decided I should go for it.

The first snow in the valley took place Oct 25, 2012 so I decided it would be a good day to climb timp the next day so I could have the place to myself. The snow didn't fill in as much as I hoped amounting to maybe 8 inches or less at 11,000 feet. Started at 6:45 am, made it to Emerald Lake at 10:09 am. By 11:25 am I had crossed the snowfield and climbed to the saddle. From the saddle it took 35 minutes to reach the south summit. Everything was covered in rhime ice. Next it was on to the true summit which I reached at 1:40 pm. I continued on to Bomber peak arriving at 3:26 pm, and from there to N. Timp by 4:28 pm. I took the Cold Fusion Coulior down which was tough going with the snow just enough to make it slick. It was close to 7 pm when I made it to the dirt road, and was lucky enough to hitch a ride with some hunters.
