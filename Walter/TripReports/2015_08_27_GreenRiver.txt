August 27, 2015 Alan Moore, Dave Moore, and  I began a 45 mile kayak trip down the Green River outside Moab, UT.  We started at the Ruby Ranch and went about 9.5 miles the first day, covering about 3 miles per hour on the lazy river.  We camped on a sandbar that night.  August 28, was our big day, and we cover about 24 miles, between 9 am and 5:30 pm.  We camped on the downriver side of the so-called “bow knot” which is a place where the river almost bend back to its self over a seven mile bend, again we were on a sandy beach.  August 30 we did the finally 11.5 miles to Mineral Bottom arriving their at noon having started out at 8:45 am.  Bob, the Moore brothers dad, dropped us off at Ruby Ranch and picked us up at Mineral Bottom.  Fun Trip!
