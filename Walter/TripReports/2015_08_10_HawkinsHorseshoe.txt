August 10, 2015 Ken, Russ and I left the Lineham trailhead parking lot at 8:00 am as we set off to hike the Hawkins Horseshoe.  The route covers three peaks; Blakiston (9547 ft – highest in Waterton), Hawkins (8839 ft), and Lineham (8950 ft).  By 8:50 am we had reached the turn off point (drainage) from the Lineham Lakes trail where we headed north and up to the summit of Blakiston.  It was a steep and long scramble to the peak requiring another 3.5 hours.  We hung out on the peak for about 30 minutes and then dropped down 1200 feet and then up another 500 feet to Hawkins, en route we passed a radio receiver thing on the west ridge of Blakiston.  It took about 1 hour and 50 minutes to reach Hawkins summit, and by 3 pm we were moving again hoping to reach Lineham by 5 pm.  Beautiful views and easy hiking along the ridge west of, and above, Lineham Lakes. When we turned east and could see over to Rowe Lakes (to the south) I realized I’d hiked that trail back in 1983 on a multi-day back packing trip with David Bovie. We topped out on Lineham by 4:40 pm and hung out till 5 pm.  From Lineham we scramble down to the Rowe Lakes trail following it to the highway and then walked 0.8 miles down the highway back to the car.  Overall the trip took from 8 am to 7 pm, and covered about 22 km.
