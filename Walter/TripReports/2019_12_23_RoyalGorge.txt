Dec 22, 2019 Ana and I drove 490 miles from Orem to Canon City, CO.  Arriving we had dinner at Chili’s and we stayed at the Hampton Inn.  Next morning, we visited the Royal Gorge Bridge.  Which is a bridge to nowhere but is the highest bridge in the USA – 955 feet above the Arkansas River.  It ranks as the 21st highest bridge in the world.   It was built simply for tourism, and up until 2014 cars were allowed on it, but no longer. We arrived a few minutes after the 8 am opening time and were the only customers there.  We spent about an hour looking around, taking photos, and walking over the bridge.  As we were leaving another group of 4 or so arrived.  It was cold out.
1.	Sign near the bridge listing the elevation at 6626 feet.
2.	The bridge floor is made from thick wooden planks, and it was erected in 1929.
3.	The length of the bridge is 1260 feet, and 955 feet above the Arkansas River.
4.	Ditto
5.	Me
6.	Ana
7.	Looking down almost 1000 feet at the Arkansas River below the bridge.  Notice the train track on the left side of the river.
8.	Sign
9.	I was going to drop a line down 1000 feet until I saw this sign.
10.	Looking off the east side, notice the tracks on the right.
11.	I was surprised the support cables were not braided.
12.	Each state has a sign on the bridge
