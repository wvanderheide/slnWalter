July 9, 2020 I flew to Minneapolis then drove north to the trailhead for Eagle Mountain.  Slept in my tent, due to the many mosquitoes, at the trailhead. July 10 – Summited Eagle Mountain, then drove to Mt Arvon MI and summited that. Camped that night in Ottawa NF off Highway 28. July 11, en route to Timm’s Hill WI, drove through Land O Lakes WI.  Next I drove to IA to Hawkeye Point.  Slept in the car that night next to a corn field.  July 12 return to Minneapolis and flew home via Dallas and San Francisco.
