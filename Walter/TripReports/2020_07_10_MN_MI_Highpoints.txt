July 9, 2020 I flew to Minneapolis then drove north to the trailhead for Eagle Mountain.  Slept in my tent, due to the many mosquitoes, at the trailhead. July 10 – Summited Eagle Mountain, then drove to Mt Arvon MI and summited that. Camped that night in Ottawa NF off Highway 28. July 11, en route to Timm’s Hill WI, drove through Land O Lakes WI.  Next I drove to IA to Hawkeye Point.  Slept in the car that night next to a corn field.  July 12 return to Minneapolis and flew home via Dallas and San Francisco.


35.	Day 3 – itinerary 
36.	Land O Lakes is a very small town (883 people) but they have a post office.  I’m not sure this town is where the Land O Lakes dairy products are produced.
37.	Another 2 hours on the road got me to Timm’s Hill
38.	County Park – home of WI high point, 1951.5 ft.
39.	There are actually two towers, but this photo hides the second (and taller) one behind the first. The second (aka taller tower, hidden in this photo) is metal and holds communication equipment, with the state high point survey marker made of concrete right underneath it (I didn’t see it). This tower is a wooden construct that can be climbed via stairs for wide views of the surrounding woodlands and lakes.
40.	Proof that I visited WI highpoint!
41.	Summit register
42.	Me at the summit register, which did not contain a working pen, so I wasn’t able to sign in.
43.	Again at the summit register
44.	On top of the lower first tower, which is about 50 feet tall
45.	The view from the lower tower.
46.	Randy, from PA, coming down the ladder on the higher second tower.  We were both amazed that the public was allowed to climb that rather tall and dangerous ladder.  Notice both towers are seen in this photo.
47.	Another shot of Randy’s descent.
48.	My ascent
49.	Me at the top of the second tower about 70 feet tall.
50.	Looking down the polished rungs of the exposed ladder.  I climbed it in Birkenstock sandals so it was a thrill.
51.	Me at the top of the ladder
52.	Looking down from tower 2 to Randy on tower 1. 
53.	Highway sign pointing to the WI highpoint
54.	Dido
55.	From Timm’s Hill to Worthington MN (the closest sizable town to Iowa’s highpoint which is about 15 miles to the south) is about 360 miles.  The drive took me 8 hours as I stopped for groceries and as I had to stop near St. Peter, MN (on highway 169) due to heavy rain from a tornado in Mankato, which I might have been caught in if hadn’t stopped at the highway rest stop for over 10 miles, as I was about 10 miles from the tornado.  Luckily no hail.
56.	Arrived at about 5:40 pm at Hawkeye Point.  While the land around the site is privately owned, the owners have championed the site as a tourist destination and has worked with the County to make sure it remains accessible – and it is done up very nicely.
57.	Me with the high point markers behind me.
58.	Me at the highpoint marker
59.	Dido
60.	Dido
61.	The view from the platform on the grain silo
62.	Another of me
63.	As the crow flies my last highpoint was 305 miles away.
64.	As the crow flies my home state highpoint was 775 miles away
65.	Me leaving the summit
66.	The classic summit plaque
67.	The silo with its view platform
68.	Another sign
69.	Old farm equipment on display
70.	Dido, with the drying barn behind and the rental car.
71.	Barn close up
72.	The rental car at the highpoint
73.	Day 4  itinerary
74.	Day 4 drive back to the MSP airport
75.	Cost and mileage of the trip
