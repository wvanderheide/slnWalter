November 19, 2013 – William DaBell and I climbed the Dirtcicle near Helper, UT.   I hiked to the top and set up a top rope as the ice was still pretty thin.  From that I learned that the highway used to go over the top of the Dirtcicle and that is why the alcove of the Dirtcicle is there (it’s not natural).  Supports from an old bridge are up there.  
I rappelled down, and volunteered to climb first this would be Williams first climbing ice.  It felt strange to be back on ice after 8.5 months off it, so the first climb I only went half way up.  By my third climb I was back in the swing of it and feeling comfortable.  I did four full laps plus the first half lap.  I also did another ½ lap trying out Williams’s tools, and that was my last lap.
It was a lot of fun, of course!

I’m in the red coat in the photos and William is in the black coat.
