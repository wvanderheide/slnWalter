Dec 23, 2019 after visiting the Royal Gorge Bridge in Colorado Ana and I drove 212 miles to the highest point in Kansas, Mount Sunflower at 4039 feet.  We arrived around 2pm and temperature were in the mid-sixties.   Mount Sunflower is located in side Kansas within a half mile of the CO/KS state line and about 22 miles from I-70.
