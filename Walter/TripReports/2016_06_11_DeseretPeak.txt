June 11, 2016 – I meet Peter at his house in Sandy, Utah at 5:30 am.  From there we drove to the Loop Campground in South Willow Fork(?).  We arrived before 7:00 am, and hit the trail by 7:10 am.  The distance to the top of the Twin Couloirs is only 2.4 miles(???) with 3239 feet elevation gain.  We reached the first creek crossing at 7:35 am, and immediately after crossing the creek we turned right (west) off the Deseret Peak trail.  The sign indicated a lake in the direction we were headed, but we never saw a lake.  By 9:30 am we reached the snow at the bottom of the couloirs, and by 9:40 am we on the skis on and started skinning up.  A group of four hikes glissaded down the west couloir as we were preparing to go up.  We skinned about 2/3 of the way up the West couloir but with the conditions fogged in and steady rain falling booting became the better option.  The steady rain caused some rock fall now and then, and with the fog obscuring our view we had to be extra attentive. By 11:00 am we reached the top of the couloir.  At the top of the couloir the wind and driving rain were strong if you crossed to the south side, but the north side was mostly out of the strong wind.  So we switched back to hiking boots, and started toward the peak only to find that in the wind we were just too wet and lacking warm enough clothes so we decided to forgo the peak and get down while we still had some body warmth left.  At 11:30 am Peter took the first turn in the West Couloir, and within 20 minutes we were at the end of the snow.  By 12:15 pm we began the hike out after having some lunch and strapping out skis onto our packs.  By 1:40 pm we made it back to Peter’s truck (6.5 hours from the time we started).  The weather was a disappointment, and we weren’t fully prepared for it, and there were quite a lot of rocks on the snow, but overall it was a successful adventure (Peter’s first time on skins).
