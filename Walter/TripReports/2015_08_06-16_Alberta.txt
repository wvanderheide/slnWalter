August 6, 2015 Ana and I left Orem at 5 am and drove north 752 miles to Cardston Alberta.  The next day was my 30 year High School Reunion in the evening.  Prior to that we showed Ana some of the sites in the area by driving out to Beazer then to Mountain View and to the East Cardston Hutterite Colony.  The reunion was fun and well attended; reminiscing , food, and games.  Next day, August 8, was the Cardston parade and CHS Class of 85 had a float.  Following the parade we had a reunion luncheon.
August 9 Ken and I, along with his friend Russ, went to Waterton prepared to boat into Glacier NP to climb Mt. Cleveland over two days, but we were not able to get a camping permit.  Instead we hiked to Bertha Lake and then to Bertha Peak.  Next day , the three of us, returned to Waterton and hiked the 22 km Hawkins Horseshoe in 11 hours.
August 11, Peter and family arrived in the evening and during the day Ana and I visited Waterton.  We saw two black bears – one near the bottom of the Bears Hump trail (a cub) and a second (big one) by the Chief Mtn road turn off.
August 12 Ana and I drove to Bellevue to do the underground mine tour, then on to Sparwood BC to see the World’s Largest truck.  In the evening we celebrated my b-day with Peter and family at moms and ate cheese cake.
August 13  Kathryn took Ana and I to Lethbridge with all the kids.  We shopped at Park Palace and got Levon/Alex’s wedding gift at Winners.  We had to hide in Winners as Alex and her sister came in and we didn’t want them to see the gift.  After shopping we had lunch (Poutine) at Piggyback Poutine.  Back in Cardston by 3 pm we headed out to St. Mary’s River to cool off from a hot 37 C day.
August 14, the boys went to Waterton.  Jon, Peter, Ken, Ryan, and me hiked from Cameron falls to Alderson Lake then on to Carthew Lakes and back.  In the evening Ana  and I visited with Kyle Henniger and I introduced her to Howard Synder.
August 15, was Levon/Alex wedding in the Cypress Hills.  The ceremony was in a field, and the reception was at Spring Point Community Hall.  Weather was chill, about 12 C or less.  I wore a toque a the wedding which was casual dress.
August 16 we drove back to Orem.  Alan Wood asked me to bring his 14 year old daughter back to Utah.  He meet us in Babb and she made the exchange to our car.  Her name is Abbey.
Overall we put almost 1900 miles on Ana’s car, plus I had three trips to Wateron with Kenny, one to Lethbridge, and one to Spring Point.
