September 4, 2009 I drove from Orem to the trailhead of Borah Peak in Idaho (550km), arriving at 10:45 pm.  Next morning I was up at 5:15 am, and hiking by 6:20 am.  I covered the 5200 vertical feet and 3.5 miles in about 3.5 hours arriving on the top of Idaho at 12,662 ft at about 9:50 am.  En route I meet up with Mark Wray a fellow AAM missionary.  Mark had looked me up nine years prior when he was in DC.  I hung out on the peak for about an hour, and made it back to the parking lot by 2pm.  I found an empty camp spot with a picnic table so I cleaned up, made lunch, and rested until about 6pm.  Arrived back in Orem just after 11:00 pm.

1.	Looking easterly from Highway 93 at Borah Peak. I took this picture around 6pm on Sept 5, 2009 as I was returning home after the climb.  Since I arrived Sept 4 at 10:45 pm I didn't get this view prior to climbing the mountain.
2.	General idea of the route to the peak.  Up to Chicken Out ridge the trail generally heads East, and then North North-East from Chicken Out to the peak.  The route is well defined.
3.	At 7:15 am I caught a glimpse to the south of peak 11308 having not seen Borah yet, I thought it might be Borah.
4.	7:30 am, another view of peak 11308.
5.	At 7:43 am Borah came into view (I had another climber point it out to me).  It is the first peak as your follow the ridge up to the left from the saddle.  Although the peak to its left appears higher from this angle, it is actually not higher.
6.	A zoomed in view of the Borah Peak at 7:43 am.
7.	The 20 foot down climb on Chicken Out Ridge to the snow filled notch (which wasn't so snow filled this late in the year).
8.	Having just past the notch (mentioned in the last photo) I was able to zoom in on the peak looking North North-East.
9.	Looking east from the saddle before the last 800 feet of climbing to the peak. About 9:10 am.
10.	9:49 am I reached an unpopulated peak.
11.	I only had the peak to myself for about 5-minutes and so as others arrived I had one take a photo of me.
12.	A view South East from the peak.
13.	By 10:10 am Mark Wary had reached the peak.  It was neat to cross paths, unexpectedly, with him on this hike.  We have only seen each other twice in the last 21 years.  The previous time was in DC in 2000.  We both served in the AAM.
14.	Just before heading down at about 10:45 am Marks son found this banner on the peak.
15.	A view from the peak of the ridge the trail follows to Chicken Out Ridge. 
16.	A zoomed view, of the same route ridge of the last picture, but with the zoom one can see the parking lot at the trailhead.
17.	Looking South East from the Saddle at 11:15 am, one of the peaks on the Horizon might be Leatherman Peak Idaho's second tallest at 12,228 ft.
18.	A view east from the saddle.
19.	Looking back at the peak at 11:30 am.
20.	Peak 11308 as seen on the descent at noon.
21.	Around 1pm I stopped to remove a layer as I was out of the wind.
22.	At 1:26pm I neared the end.
23.	By 1:52 pm the parking lot was clearly visible, and within a few minutes the hike/climb was over.
24.	Sign 1 at the trailhead.
25.	Sign 2 at the trailhead.
26.	After the hike I took a few pictures of the view from near the campground.  Arriving at night, and beginning the hike in the dark I wasn't able to see this until after the hike.
27.	Key items labeled.
