Borah Peak, ID, 12,662 ft. – September 5, 2009, HP #7: Borah was raised seven feet during a 1983 earthquake.
After work on Friday September 4, 2009 I took I-15 north from Utah to Blackfoot Idaho, then US-26 north west to Arco where I continued north west on US-93 through Mackay and finally to Birch Springs road to the southwest ridge trailhead of Borah Peak.  It was a 330 mile drive. Upon arriving at 10:45 pm I folded down the back seat of my SUV and made myself comfortable for the night.
Next morning I was up at 5:15 am, and by 6:20 am I was following a trail upward to the east between pine trees and sage brush.   Soon, as I headed up a series of switchbacks, I caught up to a party ahead of me. I put my head down, and picked up my pace and as I overtook them one of them called me by name.  I turned to see Ray Williams who I had worked with in Australia back in 1988.  These days Ray is a pilot and lives in Idaho. In the last twenty-one years we had only seen each other one other time when nine years prior his work had taken him to the DC area.  He was climbing Borah with his son, and it was a pleasant surprise to run into an old friend especially at such a remote location.  I didn’t want to interrupt his father and son time so I was soon on my way.
About 80 minutes into the hike the trees thinned out and Borah Peak came into view, I was over 9000 feet by this point. This was my first time seeing it with my own eyes, as I had arrived in the dark not getting a view of the mountain from the highway.  From this vantage point the summit looked lower than its neighboring peak an optical illusion as often happens in the mountains. At roughly 10,500 feet the trail enters an alpine plateau, and about 800 vertical feet later a rocky buttress is encountered which is the bottom of the legendary Chicken Out Ridge, considered the crux of the outing.  
Chicken Out Ridge involves continuous stout third class scrambling - with a few fourth class moves sprinkled in for added spice- as it gains 300 vertical feet. The ridge has exposure on both sides with the north side being the more perilous as it looks down 2000 or so feet.  Sounds daunting, but the rock is solid with amble trustworthy hand and foot holds, and as such it is nothing to be worried about - some folks even take their dogs up and over it.  The ridge ends at a 20 foot down climb landing on a snow filled notch (which wasn't so snow filled this late in the year).  Just in case I had packed an ice axe with me, but there wasn’t any need to unstrap it from my bag.  The route travels north east from this point to the peak, on the southwest ridge - I’m guessing this section is the route namesake. This next section is narrow, but was easily passable, and leads slightly downward to a saddle which I reached at 9:10 am.  From the saddle it’s another 800 feet or so up to the summit, which required 40 minutes to climb.
 This southwest ridge trail is steep gaining, on average, close to 1500 ft. per mile as it surges 5200 vertical feet in 3.5 miles from the trailhead.  I took 3.5 hours to ascend it, and was privileged to arrive to an unpopulated peak.  An American flag was flying from a flag pole prompted up by the summit cairn with an Idaho flag sunk below it on the group of rocks. 
I only had the peak to myself for about five minutes as I took in the beautiful landscapes of the Lost River Range with its many 12000 foot peaks scattered before me.  No longer alone I took advantage of the company by having someone take my photo as I posed holding the faded jean "Mt. Borah, elev. 12,662 ft." banner, which is stored on the peak for all to model with, as I sported my 70’s style sunglasses.  Those who climbed this mountain before 1983 would have needed a banner labeled with 12,655 ft. as Borah was raised seven feet during a 1983 earthquake that shook the area.
By 10:10 am Ray and his boy arrived, and we took a couple of photos together.  While chitchatting we both mentioned a desire to one day climb Denali – Ray hoped to climb it with his son.
I hung out on the peak for about an hour. Ultimately retracing my steps returning to the parking lot by 2pm.  Near the trailhead I stopped to read a “Safety Tips For Hiking Borah” sign which had been in the dark for my ascent.  The sign said to plan on a 12-hour round trip but besides that it made some reasonable points.  A second sign gave the origins of the mountains name stating “Named in 1933 for William E. Borah, Idaho’s senator from1906 to 1940”.
Next to the parking lot I found an empty camping spot with a picnic table. After removing my boots I cleaned up then made lunch at the table.  It was quiet so I rested hoping, but failing, to fall asleep. Around 6pm I began the long drive back arriving home just after 11:00 pm.

September 4, 2009 I drove from Orem to the trailhead of Borah Peak in Idaho (550km), arriving at 10:45 pm.  Next morning I was up at 5:15 am, and hiking by 6:20 am.  I covered the 5200 vertical feet and 3.5 miles in about 3.5 hours arriving on the top of Idaho at 12,662 ft at about 9:50 am.  En route I meet up with Mark Wray a fellow AAM missionary.  Mark had looked me up nine years prior when he was in DC.  I hung out on the peak for about an hour, and made it back to the parking lot by 2pm.  I found an empty camp spot with a picnic table so I cleaned up, made lunch, and rested until about 6pm.  Arrived back in Orem just after 11:00 pm.

1.	Looking easterly from Highway 93 at Borah Peak. I took this picture around 6pm on Sept 5, 2009 as I was returning home after the climb.  Since I arrived Sept 4 at 10:45 pm I didn't get this view prior to climbing the mountain.
2.	General idea of the route to the peak.  Up to Chicken Out ridge the trail generally heads East, and then North North-East from Chicken Out to the peak.  The route is well defined.
3.	At 7:15 am I caught a glimpse to the south of peak 11308 having not seen Borah yet, I thought it might be Borah.
4.	7:30 am, another view of peak 11308.
5.	At 7:43 am Borah came into view (I had another climber point it out to me).  It is the first peak as your follow the ridge up to the left from the saddle.  Although the peak to its left appears higher from this angle, it is actually not higher.
6.	A zoomed in view of the Borah Peak at 7:43 am.
7.	The 20 foot down climb on Chicken Out Ridge to the snow filled notch (which wasn't so snow filled this late in the year).
8.	Having just past the notch (mentioned in the last photo) I was able to zoom in on the peak looking North North-East.
9.	Looking east from the saddle before the last 800 feet of climbing to the peak. About 9:10 am.
10.	9:49 am I reached an unpopulated peak.
11.	I only had the peak to myself for about 5-minutes and so as others arrived I had one take a photo of me.
12.	A view South East from the peak.
13.	By 10:10 am Mark Wary had reached the peak.  It was neat to cross paths, unexpectedly, with him on this hike.  We have only seen each other twice in the last 21 years.  The previous time was in DC in 2000.  We both served in the AAM.
14.	Just before heading down at about 10:45 am Marks son found this banner on the peak.
15.	A view from the peak of the ridge the trail follows to Chicken Out Ridge. 
16.	A zoomed view, of the same route ridge of the last picture, but with the zoom one can see the parking lot at the trailhead.
17.	Looking South East from the Saddle at 11:15 am, one of the peaks on the Horizon might be Leatherman Peak Idaho's second tallest at 12,228 ft.
18.	A view east from the saddle.
19.	Looking back at the peak at 11:30 am.
20.	Peak 11308 as seen on the descent at noon.
21.	Around 1pm I stopped to remove a layer as I was out of the wind.
22.	At 1:26pm I neared the end.
23.	By 1:52 pm the parking lot was clearly visible, and within a few minutes the hike/climb was over.
24.	Sign 1 at the trailhead.
25.	Sign 2 at the trailhead.
26.	After the hike I took a few pictures of the view from near the campground.  Arriving at night, and beginning the hike in the dark I wasn't able to see this until after the hike.
27.	Key items labeled.
