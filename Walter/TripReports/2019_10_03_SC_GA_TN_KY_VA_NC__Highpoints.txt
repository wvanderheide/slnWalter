Oct 3, 2019 at 12:15 am I caught a red-eye flight from Salt Lake City to Charlette, NC and then to Greenville, SC.  I got in around 9:30 am EST, drove my rental car to Sassafras Mountain, SC arriving close to noon.  On the way I picked up a few groceries.  Sassafras Mountain is shared by North and South Carolina, but is the highest point in SC.  It’s nothing to see, and you all but drive to the summit where they have a newly built (just this year) summit platform tower, which is half in SC and half in NC.  There is a stone marker with a plaque on in on the SC side to the east of the platform marking the high point.
After spending 30 minutes or so on the peak I drove to Georgia to Brasstown Bald.  Which turned out to be a very nice mountain.  Heavily forested with weird shiny leaf tropical like plants.  I had to pay $5 to park, which also included a shuttle bus to the summit, but I elected to walk the 6/10 of a mile.  The summit had a large platform, tower, and small visitor center.  The views in all 360 degrees were amazing.  When I left, I was the last person on the summit leaving just after 5pm having arrived around 4pm at the parking lot.
Next I had to drive to Smokemont campground in the Great Smokey Mountains NP of NC/TN.  There was a parade going on in Hiawassee, GA and they blocked the highway so I had to wait there for 30 or 40 minutes.  It was dark and around 9pm when I finally arrived at my reserved camp spot.  The fellows next door where playing guitar and I worried they would keep me up all night, but they quieted down by 10 pm and I slept very well.  I had the spot till noon, and it was close to 11 am when I finally left.
Oct 4, 2019, I made it to Clingmans Dome by noon with the 20-mile drive and the half mile hike.  I was shocked that the large parking area for Clingmans Dome was all but full, but then again it was a Friday, but I found a parking spot.  A steady stream of people, many on the biggest adventure of their life’s apparently, where going up and down the paved half mile to and from the summit.  I got a few people to snap photos of me on the tower and approaching it, and then I headed over to the Appalachian Trail to walk a bit of it since it’s the highest point of that trail.  I told an older couple about my quest and they told me about a young family they meet a few weeks ago who were trying to set the record with their baby being the youngest person ever to visit every state in the shortest time frame, they had six weeks to do it.
Following Clingmans Dome, I stopped at Newfound Gap, then headed north into Tennessee on Hwy 441, and stopped at the Chimney Tops trail.  I did the under 2-mile hike to the view of Chimney Tops (trail was closed at this point, and hiking to rocks were not allowed).  I was there at 2:45 pm Oct 4, 2019.  After the hike I drove 50 plus miles on scenic winding roads to the west end of the National Park to the Abram's Creek Campground where I had spot A10 reserved.   The west end of the Smoky Mountain NP I had read is not popular but the campground was small, crowded, noisy, and full.  Thankfully the spot next to mine stayed empty.
Oct 5, I was eager to leave Abram’s Creek Campground so I got up with the sun, and was on the road around 8 am, headed to the high point of Kentucky via the town of Harlan (as featured on the TV series Justified).  I made good time to Harlan covering the 120 miles in under 3 hours via some winding slower roads.  I should have stopped in Harlan, but I was eager to reach the high point so didn’t.  
I ended up on Hwy 38 from Harlan toward VA because Google maps shows an "old hwy 38" that connects to HWY 38 (a left turn from 38 to old 38 - 28.1 miles from Harlan). It also shows that "old hwy 38" becomes Black Mtn Ridge Road as it switches back and forth to the north and north east and goes over the private property of Black Mtn, KY to within 200 yards of it's true summit (unlike HWY 160 - the actual way to go - which gets you to within 1.5 miles from the true summit, and truly connects to Black Mtn Ridge Road).
Well, Old Hwy 38 isn't marked, and I couldn't find it. Plus I can tell you this, now that I have visited the summit of Black Mtn, Black Mtn Ridge Road is gated closed 200 yards from the summit for those trying to continue west. In other words, even if I had found old hwy 38, and even if it did connect to Black Mtn Ridge Road, one still couldn't drive to the summit from HWY 38.
I ended up in Keokee VA (about 3.4 miles from the non-existing old Hwy 38), where I asked for directions to Black Mountain, and was sent SW to Hwy 421, 13 miles in the wrong direction. At this point I took highways 421 to 58, and 58 to Big Stone Gap, then 23 to Inman to get on 160 and up to the VA/KY line to Black Mtn Ridge Road and 1.5 miles to the summit. From Keokee, VA to Inman is only 10.6 miles - so asking for directions cost me 27 miles (which is about an hour on those windy roads). Bottom line you can't 100% trust Google Maps, and you definitely can't trust hill-billy directions to Black Mountain.  I got to the summit of Black by 2:30 pm about 1.5 hours or more then what I expected.  The highpoint of HWY 160 is the border of KY/VA, and has a sign which incorrectly lists Black Mountains elevation as 4,145 ft when really it is 4,139 ft and further up the mountain.  
There was a hill-billy and his girlfriend parked at the Radar Tower eating McDonalds, and I got him to take a photo of me.  Then I continued up to the lookout tower area to see what was up there. Was only able to drive up a hill then I had to park and walk 200 yards to the tower.  It wasn’t climbable but in looking around I found a summit plaque on a rock, so I then knew I was at Kentucky’s highest point. 
As I drove down the weeded infested an often washed out Black Mtn Ridge road a pickup truck was coming up, but he pulled over for me and I got my low clearance Toyota Corolla past him with out scraping anything.  It was just after 3pm when I headed down the mountain via Hwy 160 headed to Mt. Rogers 110 miles to the east.
I arrived at a place called Elk Garden and the AT trail on White Top Road, in thick fog the evening of Oct 5 to a full parking lot.  It started to rain and was cold, must have been 8pm (ish).  I got the parking spot of a fellow who was leaving, and I organized my things, from inside the car, for the next day’s hike.  Had planned to camp behind the trees south of the parking lot but with the weather I decided to sleep in the back seat of the car. 
Oct 6, 2019 – I was awake, with breakfast in my stomach, and on the Appalachian Trail by 7:15 am.  It was foggy and wet but the rain had stopped.  No one else was heading up when I started up.  A car did arrive as I left the parking lot but they didn’t follow me up the AT.  After crossing White Top Road, and going through a gate I came to a sign for the AT and another for a horse trail.  I took the AT up a barren hill with white blazed fence posts as markers soon I entered the forest.  After 2 miles (which seemed way less) I came to a trail fork to a spring, and I stayed on the AT.  Occasionally there were camps set up, and a few people where hiking down. I seemed to be alone going up.  Maybe 3 miles in I came to a open spot to the east of a fence and there I saw signs of ponies but no ponies were seen through the thick fog, so I continued on the AT up.  Around mile 4 you leave the AT and head west on a blue blazed trail for a half mile or less to the wooded summit.  I made it up to the 5729 ft summit in under 2 hours, having gained 1295 feet.

On the summit was another hiker.  He had come up from via Massie Gap in Grayson Highlands State Park.  He was from Oregon and worked for Benchmark maps (I have 3 of their map books).  Nice guy.  He took a photo of me.  I spent about 30 minutes on the summit and was back to the car by 11:10 am. 
When I reached the high meadow by back tracking on the blue blazed trail to the AT, the fog lifted, and ponies were in site.  Fellow hikers told me they had approached them so I walked down to them to get a closer photo, leaving the AT trail.  In the meadow was a sign pointing out the horse trail route back to Elk Garden.  I believe the trail was the Highlands Horse Trail which sort of paralleled the east of the AT and arrived back at Elk Garden, making my hike sort of a loop rather than a full back track.  On the Highlands Horse Trail I passed two girls going up, then I overtook a family (one-child with parents) and next encounter two guys taking down their tent.  I confirmed that my trail lead back to Elk Garden with the two guys.
