Sept 8, 2013 I meet up with Mike Sullivan in Farson Wy from which we drove to the Big Sandy trailhead en route to hiking into the Cirque of the Towers. We camped at the trailhead and next day we hike the 9 miles into the Cirque of the Towers. Tuesday (Sept 10) we climbed 11,884 Pingora Peak via the Northeast Face route. Next day we got rained out, and the following day we got a break in the rain but it was to wet to climb so I hiked around to the various lakes in the area. Friday we woke to clear skies and set out to climb Wolfs Head, only to have to bail 2 pitches into it due to rain moving in. The rain delayed and we were able to scramble up to the Col between Wolfs Head and Overhanging tower, but on the descent we got caught in the rain. The afternoon of the 13th when the rain slowed we packed up and hiked out, fortunately the rain didn't return.

1.	Sept 9, 2013 arriving at the Cirque of the Towers in the Popo Agie Wilderness region of the Wind River range of Wyoming. 11,884 ft Pingora Peak is directly in front of hiker Mike Sullivan. It took us close to six hours to cover the 9 miles from the Big Sandy Trailhead to our camp spot in the basin above (SW) of Lonesome Lake.
2.	Looking NW at the impressive granitic mountains and sheer cliffs we planned to climb. 3:15 pm Sept 9, 2013.
3.	The peak on the right is Pingora, which we would climb the next day (Sept 10) via the Northeast Face listed as one of the 50 Classic Climb's of North America.
4.	NE face route up Pingora Peak.  We did it in less than 10 pitches.
5.	Walter only 1/3 of the way up Pingora, but Lonesome Lake already looks pretty tiny from here. Photo by Mike Sullivan.  The NE Face is about 1000 vertical feet of climbing.

16.	Rappelling down the south side.  It required one 30 m rap, follow by three double rope (60 m or less) raps to reach the bottom. The climb was approximately 1000 feet.
17.	That evening (Sept 10) back at camp the same moose we saw at Lonesome Lake on our approach to Pingora wandered through our camp.

19.	Wednesday, Sept 11, was a cloudy rainy day all day.  In fact it rained for 24 hours straight.  One of the Warrior Peaks.  The day was spent over sleeping!
20.	Sept 12, the clouds remained but the rain stopped and by noon I was out exploring the area as it was to wet to rock climb. This water fall can be seen from all around the cirque and we were camped just west of it.

24.	At 12:45 pm, just over the crest of Jackass pass, this amazing view of the aptly named Arrowhead Lake appeared.
25.	Look SE across Arrowhead Lake.
26.	To the west of our camp was small lake unnamed on the maps but known as Hidden Lake.

37.	Cirque Lake was as smooth as glass and made a fine mirror for the peak above it.

49.	The storm that caused us to bail off Wolfs Head, held off giving as a brief window of time to scramble up the col between Overhanging tower and Wolfs Head.  This pic looks westerly from the col over Cirque lake with Mitchell Peak below the lake.  About 10:15 am Sept 13, 2013.
50.	At the col Mike heads south, toward Wolfs Head, 10:25 am.
51.	Mike looks into the valley on the west side of the col.  Shadow lake can be seen on the left side.

54.	Heading back to the top of the col.
55.	By 10:40 am, the rain arrived, as we head back toward Cirque Lake, en route to our camp.
56.	Back at the tents, by noon, the rain poured, and I sorted gear inside my dry tent.
