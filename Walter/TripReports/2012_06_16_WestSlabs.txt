June 16, 2012 – I met up with Brad Yates, Andrew May, and Alex and Lani Wilson at the Mount Olympus trailhead on Wasatch Blvd.  We left two shuttle cars there and then drove around to the North side to climb the West Slabs, with the plan being to continue on from the top of the slabs to both the North and South Peak, and return to the shuttle vehicles.  We started hiking around 9:15 am, and reached the gully that leads to the slabs within 20 minutes.  By 10:15 am we were at the base of the slabs.  

The west slabs are very impressive looking when viewed looking to the south from most anywhere in Salt Lake City, and from a distance they look difficult to climb.  In reality they are an extremely fun, low 5th class level climbing route of approximately 1800 vertical feet at a 65-degree angle.  Using a rope, one would likely do the face in 10 pitches, but the 65 degree angle and the abundance of large holds makes a rope optional.

We started up directly above the coulior unroped.  About 50 feet up Brad, who wasn’t wearing climbing shoes,  got in to a situation where he felt unsafe, and so Andrew got out a rope and put him on belay, just to get him off that section.  Meanwhile Lani and I continued to free solo, while Alex stayed down with the other two.  About 350 feet up, around 11 am,  I stopped and waited for Lani, and we chatted while waiting for the other three.  They all joined us unroped, and we all finished the climb unroped.  

I had heard there are bolted anchors at the top of each pitch but I only saw one bolt.  We reached the top of the West  Slabs at 12:08 am.  So at a leisurely pace it took about 1.5 hours to climb the slabs.

We changed out of our climbing shoes, had some water and snacks, took a couple of pictures, and we were ready to continue on to the Peaks.  As we left Lani spotted a rattle snake very close to where Brad had been standing.  

We reach the false north summit within 40 minutes of class 3 scrambling, and the true North summit at 1:19 pm. Along the way we encounter another rattle snack. Again we took pictures and ate and drank and soon were hiking again.  We lost maybe 250 feet, getting off the North Peak (8959 ft), which we had to regain up to the South Peak (9026 ft). At 2:10 pm were had reached the South Peak, about 5 hours from the start.  A few more picture were taken, the summit log was signed, and we were on our way down by 2:20 pm. It is a 3.5 mile hike, over 4200 vertical feet, from the south summit to the trailhead.  It took about 15 minutes to reach the saddle, and by 3:50 pm we were back at the shuttle cars, a little over 6.5 hours total.

1.	Mount Olympus. The west slabs is the rock face on the left side.

3.	Andrew, Lani and Alex in the coulior on the approach to the West Slabs. Fortunately there was very little snow left and so neither crampons nor ice axe were needed.
4.	Andrew, Lani and Alex in the coulior on the approach to the West Slabs.
5.	Brad on the first pitch, probably the trickiest section of the whole 1800 foot climb.
6.	Maybe 150 feet up, this is a view of the approximately 65 degree angle of the West Slabs.
7.	Walter about 600 feet up at after about 35 minutes of climbing (11:10 am).
8.	Looking down from 600 feet up Andrew can be seen on the left and the approach coulior on the right.
9.	Andrew May on the ledge about 4 pitches (600 feet) up.
10.	This is about as steep as it ever got, but as you can see holds were plentiful. Andrew May.
11.	Walter
12.	Lani and Alex. 11:33 am about half way up.
13.	Andrew and Lani 3/4 of the way up.
14.	Alex Wilson
15.	Walter
16.	We ran into Carol Masheter about 400 or 500 feet below the top of the slabs. In March 2012, at the age of 65, Carol became the oldest woman in the world to have climbed the seven summits. Notice her choice of climbing shoes!!
17.	Lani, Andrew, and Alex within 50 feet of the top of the slabs.
18.	A few minutes after noon, after about 1.5 hours of climbing, we all reached the top of the slabs. Left to right: Lani and Alex Wilson, Andrew May (crouching down), and Brad Yates.
19.	We noticed this rattle snake just was we were ready to continue on to the 8959 ft North peak.
20.	View NE from the top of the slabs. The 9026 feet south peak is on the right.
21.	Lani and Andrew en route to the North peak at about 1 pm.
22.	Alex with SLC behind him. Around this time we encountered a second rattle snake.
23.	Alex and Lani on the false North summit just after 1 pm.
24.	Walter on the false North summit
25.	Lani, Alex and Brad on the true North summit of Mt. Olympus. June 16, 2012 at 1:19 pm. 8959 ft.
26.	Alex and Lani in between the North and South peaks.
27.	Heading up the north side of the South Summit is about at steep as the west slabs, but much shorter.
28.	By 2:10 pm we had reached the South summit at 9026 feet. To this point, from the start of the hike, took about 5 hours.
29.	Andrew May chill-axing, on the 9026 feet South Summit of Mt. Olympus.
30.	The view from the south peak to the north peak. We had to down climb about 250 vertical feet in scrambling between the two peaks. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~By 2:20 pm we started the descent. The 3.5 mile downhill trail took about 1.5 hours to walk. Overall, start to finish, was just over 6.5 hours.
