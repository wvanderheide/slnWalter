July 24 is a Utah holiday known as Pioneer Day.  Since it fell on a Thursday this year (2008) I decided to take Friday off of work and head out to the High Uintas to climb some peaks.  July 24 was spent driving to the Henrys Fork trailhead, and hiking to Dollar Lake.  The hike in only took three hours, so after I got my camp set up and some dinner in me, and wandered over to neighboring Henrys Fork Lake just to see it.  The first night, about 1 am my restless sleep was interrupted by two moose feeding less than 50 yards from my tent.


The next day I was off by 9 am to climb Gilbert Peak (13, 442 ft), and Gunsight Peak (13,263 ft).  I reached Gilbert Peak within 2.5 hours, and although the from the peak were nice the climb was without views and rather mundane.  From Gilbert I traversed over to Gunsight Peak arriving on top at 1:15 pm, where I enjoyed the views in all directions.  I was back to my camp at Dollar Lake before 4pm and was greeted by the two moose of the night before who were again feeding close to my camp.  The two moose were joined by four others who were swimming in the lake.


The third day out I got an early start leaving camp by 7 am and arriving at the base of the Toilet Bowl (notch between Henrys Fork and Dome peaks) shortly after 8 am.  It took less than one hour to climb the Toilet Bowl, and about 45 minutes to summit West Gunsight (Dome) Peak (13,103 ft).  From Dome I wandered over to Henrys Fork Peak (13,260 ft), and followed its east ridge to the peak.  The views the whole climb were amazing, and the climb presented a few technical and dangerous sections.  The climb up Henrys Fork Peak was my favorite of the trip.  I reached the peak by noon, and was soon sprinkled on and so I hurried down.  After a brief lunch just below the false peak, where I had stashed some water bottles, I checked my watch and it was only 1 pm so I decided to climb Kings Peak (13,528 ft).  By 1:15 pm I had reached Anderson Pass in steady rain; in spite of the lightening danger I decided to go ahead and climb Kings Peak.  Full of fear I practically ran to the top, pausing once when the true summit came into view and I could hear the static in the air as it buzzed between the trekking poles on my back pack and nearly shocked me as I posed for a self-portrait.  The rain turned to grauple short of the peak, and I met a fellow and his two kids hunkered down a few vertical feet from the summit.  I left my pack near them and braved the peak for some quick video footage at 2pm.  I returned to the family and by 2:15 pm they decided to brave the peak, and after a few minutes I joined them and had them take a couple of pictures of me.  My descent down the toilet bowl was in steady rain. When I arrived back at camp my tent was blown out of position with the continual strong winds and so I quickly moved my camp to a more sheltered location.  No other campers remained near the lake, but I soon realized that one group had set up about 1,000 yards west of the lake and I warned one of them about the moose in the area.


Day four I packed up and headed back to the trailhead, arrived around 11:45 pm after 2 hours and 45 minutes of marching what seemed to be an endless trail!  I passed one-solo hiker who I had seen descending Kings Peak the day before, and a family of three hikers.
