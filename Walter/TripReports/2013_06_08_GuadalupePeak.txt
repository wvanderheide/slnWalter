Guadalupe Peak, TX, 8,749 ft. – June 8, 2013, HP #15:  I was a little less cautious in watching out for rattlesnakes on this leg of the trip.
Friday morning I got up at my regular time of seven.  After spending nine hours at work, I drove from Springville, Utah to the SLC international airport to catch a flight to El Paso, Texas via Phoenix Arizona. I arrived in El Paso at midnight, June 8, 2013, feeling quite sleepy, and picked up a rental car.
From the airport I drove to Wal-Mart and picked up a few grocery.  Following Wal-Mart I found highway 180/62 and drove east for about 110 miles to Guadalupe Mountains National Park.  En route I encountered, for the first time in my life, an “lnland (aka Interior) Check Point” operated by the US Border Patrol.  As I approached I assumed it was a weigh station, but as I entered I had this strange feeling that I was crossing the border.  So I asked the agent as much and he told me that it was an inland check point and that the border agents have the right to set up check points anywhere within 100 miles of the border.  He asked me where I was going, seemed a little surprised due to the late hour, and wondered where I would be staying. I told him I would sleep in the car.  There was another officer nearby with a dog, they went behind the car and I assumed the dog was sniffing for drugs.  Once the officer’s apparent curiosity was satisfied he asked me to state my country of citizenship, and pleased with my answer he sent me on my way.
By 3:00 am I arrived at the Pine Springs Campground, and spent the next hour looking around, getting food ready, and generally organizing my stuff for my pending hike to the highpoint of Texas - Guadalupe Peak at 8,749 feet tall.  The hike rises just over 3,000 vertical feet in 4.25 miles.  I figured I could cover that easily in three hours up and two and a half hours down, and I wanted to leave the park before 2pm so I could make it back to the airport two or more hours before my return flight.  Having the time and not wanting to deal with darkness, I decided to try to catch an hour of sleep in the car.  I did doze off, but as if on cue I woke up 5 am, to a hint of dawn. So I grabbed my pack, adding my headlamp to it (instead of wearing it), and was on the trail by 5:15 am.  As I wandered up several switch backs the sun was soon up, and the temperature was very comfortable for a t-shirt.  
To estimate distances as I walked I referred to document I had printed from the NPS website, and about 1.5 miles into the hike, I calculated that I was covering about 0.5 miles every 15 minutes. At that rate I reasoned that I would likely be on top by 7:30 am.  The walking was easy, the trial was direct and by 7:10 am I reached the top of Texas, without having seen another person nor having to stop to drink any water.  I snapped a few pictures of the summit monument.  At this early morning hour the sky in all directions was a cloud-free brilliant blue.  Next I ate my breakfast sandwich and both signed and read the summit log book, greatly appreciating the solitude.  Several summit registry entries mentioned the lack of a view due to hazy conditions, definitely not the case this morning.   Around 7:40 am I mistakenly thought I heard voices, so I rapidly grabbed my pack and started down.  
I had lots of time, so I decided to travel cross-country over to El Capitan to the south, keenly aware of potential rattlesnakes.  El Capitan, although not a true peak, sits about 664 feet below the Texas highpoint, but due to the nature of the landscape one must drop closer to 900 feet before he can begin climbing up to El Capitan.  Within an hour of leaving Guadalupe I encountered a green military ammo box (exactly like the one on Guadalupe Peak) on a highpoint of El Capitan.  My instinct wasn’t convinced this was the actual highpoint, but as I looked around nothing seemed noticeable higher so I accepted it as the highpoint, opened the ammo box and signed the summit log.  It hadn’t been signed for a few months. The views off the cliff face to the west were breathtaking, and the view back, to the north, of the Texas highpoint made Guadalupe Peak more impressive.  At this point I noticed two hikers at the monument.
I hoped I would encounter a trail on El Capitan which I could follow back to the parking lot, but since I didn’t I opted for the prudent thing to do and descend El Capitan and climb the 900 feet or so back up to the Guadalupe trail.  This took me just under an hour, as I was a little less cautious in watching out for rattlesnakes on this leg of the trip.  Once back on the established trail, I made good time only crossing paths with four or five groups heading up, all who were quite friendly.  I glanced over at El Capitan a few times and questioned if the summit register was really on the highpoint. The temperature remained pleasant, with the occasional strong wind gust typical of the area, and by 11:15 am I was back at my rental car having reached two peaks in about as much time as I had allotted for just the one.  
With nothing else around to catch my interest I decided to head back to El Paso, where I could get some lunch and hopefully catch a nap at the airport prior to my 6:30 pm departing flight.  As I headed west on highway 180/62 I looked back at the peaks, and noticed that the sky was filling with dust, gone were the clear views I had enjoyed that morning. 
On the outskirts of El Paso, as I approached, I stopped at different Wal-Mart then the night before.  Got myself some fruit and juice and continued into El Paso.  Tired and not really interested in looking around I decided to fill up the car with gas and return to the airport in search of a nap.  It must have been close to 2pm when I dropped off the rental car, and I found a restroom in the airport to clean up and change out of my hiking gear.  By the time I checked-in, cleared TSA, and found my gate it was after 3pm, and so I sat down hoping to sleep.  It was uncomfortable to sleep sitting and so I moved to a couch near one of the TVs, and I managed to doze in and out for the next 45 minutes or so.
Eventually it was time for my flight to Phoenix and from there to Salt Lake City.  I arrived close to 11pm, and was home a few minutes after 12 am. After 41.5 hours of no real sleep I was exhausted, and so happy to jump into my bed. It was an easy quick hike to the top of Texas, but a fun adventure nonetheless, and I have now reached 15 of the 50 US states highpoints.
