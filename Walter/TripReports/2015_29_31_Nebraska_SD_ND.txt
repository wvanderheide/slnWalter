May 29, 2015 Ana and I drove to Nebraska to Panorama Point the state high point.  Close by is the tri-state corner for NE, WY, and CO so we hit that first.  From Panorama Point we drove north to the Black Hills where we spent the night at Motel 6 in Hot Springs, SD.  Lots of miles that day, about 700.
Day 2 – May 30, we let the motel by 6 am and drove through Custer State park to Sylvan Lake.  En route we saw bison, turkeys, deer, and antelope.  On the Needles Highway we pasted through two one-way tunnels with the narrow of the two being only about 8 feet wide.  From Sylvan lake we hiked 3.5 miles to the top of Harney Peak SD highpoint.  Even with an hour on the peak, the whole hike was done by noon for a total of 4 hours.  In the afternoon we visited Mt. Rushmore and were impressed with it.  From Rushmore we had an early dinner in Hill City and then drove up to Deadwood, SD where we found primitive camping at the Mt. Roosevelt Picnic Area.   It rained most of the night and was windy.  
Day 3 – May 31, we continued north into North Dakota to its state highpoint, White Butte.  That was a quick hike of under an hour round trip.  By noon we were heading south again.  Drove by Devils Tower in Wyoming, and then to Casper for dinner.  From Casper we continued to Rawlins and checked into a motel there at 10 pm.  Way too much driving for one day!
Day 4 – Return to Orem.  Almost ran out of gas when the station near Fort Bridger had its pumps closed and we didn’t have enough to get to Evanston.  Had to go into the town of Fort Bridger for a couple of gallons to tie us over to Evanston.  Lot of driving but great trip.  Loved the Black Hills and would like to go back to rock climb.
