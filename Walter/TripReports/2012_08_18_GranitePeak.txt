I woke up at 3:00 am August 17, 2012 about 45 minutes earlier then I needed to, but sleep wouldn’t return. As planned I left the house at 4:30 am and drove up to Peter’s place. From there we got into his truck and drove North through Utah and Yellowstone to Cook City, Montana where we had lunch. By 2:07 pm we were on the Lady of the Lakes trail thinking we’d make it to Lone Elk Lake between 6 and 6:30 pm. 
The walking was quick and before we knew it the trail had faded away, and we were wondering if we’d missed a turn. A quick look at the map showed that all we had to do was head due north, so we continued north ignoring the feeling that we weren’t on route. By 5pm we reached a lake at the top of a steep hill, and we wondered why it wasn’t on the map, but the map was of poor quality and it looked like there might be a blue spot under the blue trail line so we kept on walking. As we rounded the east side of the lake we encountered another hiker and he seemed to confirm that Lower Aero Lake was to the North East about an hour’s hike away. So we tried to go NE, but we couldn’t find the lake. Finally we had to accept that we had messed up, and the realization that Granite Peak would not be in reach this trip settled in hard on us. What a disappointment! Where had we gone wrong was the question we mulled over and over for hours as we back tracked to the Lake and then down the hill in the dark. By 10:00 pm, we found a good camp spot near Zimmer Creek and we stopped. Now with the peak out of our reach we hoped, tomorrow, to at least find Aero Lake and discover how and where we had gone wrong. 
The next morning as soon as the sun came up, we woke up. By 6:30 pm we were out of the tent. The realization came that just maybe we’d have enough time today to get back on track and even make it up Granite Peak. It was a long shot, and a long ways to go, but we decided to give it a try. This morning we had luck on our side as we discovered we'd walked far enough back, the night before, that we were again at the trail. Within 30 minutes we were back down to the intersection of Zimmer creek and Broadwater River. Next it was through the trees, on the south of the river, and then across the river, and we found a trail heading downstream, and we knew we were on route. By noon we reached Rough Lake, and there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, and we thought maybe, just maybe, we still had a chance of reaching the peak. So we continued up Sky Top creek and along the Sky Top Lakes and soon we spotted Granite Peak. 
By 2:00 pm we found a camp spot and by 3:00 pm, with lighter loads, we were aiming for the peak. It didn’t take more than 30 minutes to reach the head of the big Sky Top Lake, and shortly after we encountered a man and woman heading down. We asked them about the SW couloir route, and we were snapped at by the woman who said “if you don’t know where you are going, we shouldn’t help you”. I returned her rudeness by impolitely waving her off as the man proceeded to chat with us. We hoped to reach the slab, on the face of the mountain, by 5:00 pm, but the walking was slow over miles and miles of boulders. 
Peter stared to feel the altitude and by 5:00 pm he told me to just go ahead and try to reach the peak, and that he would follow along at his own pace. Feeling a bit guilty I decided to go for it, knowing that I needed to turn around by 7:00 pm at the latest. By 5:30 pm I had traversed the base of the slab and was looking up the SW couloir, and up I went. At 6:15 pm I reached a point that was high class 4. Worried about the return down climb I searched for an easier way and after trying three different ways up I just about turned around. But then something told me to give it one more go, and up I went reaching the summit ridge by 6:25 pm and the peak by 6:30 pm. 
Out came the camera, snap, snap. Next I signed the summit log, and had a bite to eat. By 6:55 pm I started down. Just off the ridge a 3 foot wide chunk of rock broke out from under me, luckily I had two good hand holds, and went zooming down as I yelled “rock, rock” over and over. I hoped Peter wasn’t below it. By 7:40 pm I was out of the couloir and skirting along the slab. By 8:00 pm I spotted Peter at our arranged meeting point on the moraine at the base of the peak, and a few minutes later I joined him. It wasn’t until 10:38 pm that we finally wandered back into camp. We’d been hiking for 14.5 hours!!! Exhausted I lay on the ground and asked Peter to take my photo.
After a few snacks we laid down to sleep.
Next morning I was up at 6:15 am with an upset stomach, and by 8:15 am we were marching out. By 9:00 am we reached Rough Lake, and by 9:45 am Lone Elk Lake was behind us. At 11:00 am we stopped along the Sky Top Creek, and soaked our sore feet as we ate some snacks. By 12:45 pm we were back at the intersection of Broadwater River and Zimmer creek, were we instantly realized how we missed the right turn the day before. Someone had blocked the right fork of the trail with some logs and so we had gone left, and crossed the creek more to the west where the trail downhill along Broadwater River could not be seen. Our lesson learned… bring a better map, and plot a few way points!!!
At 2:15 pm we reached the truck, plenty tried and with more than one sore muscle!! 
August 20, 2012, a glance at a terrain map showed we had wandered to Zimmer Lake about 2 - 2.5 miles from the turn off to Aero Lake, where the trail ended. From Zimmer Lake we’d gone up to the 11,000 foot south ridge of Mt. Wilse, wandering both south and east, adding at least another 1.5 miles. Overall we walked 8 miles extra from the turn off to Aero Lake. I'd also guess that from our first camp spot to Broadwater River (aka Star Creek) was 1 to 1.5 miles. So over all we added around 11 miles to our trip.
In summary, day one we walked from 2pm till 10 pm, covering 12 or so miles (2,400 vertical feet -from 8,800 to 11,200 ft). Day two we walked from 8:00 am till 10:38 pm covering around 16 miles and going up at least 4000 vertical feet (not sure how much we went up and down, but we started somewhere closed to 8,800 feet and went up to 12,799 ft). Day three we walked from 8:15 am till 2:15 am covering about 11 miles, followed by a 450 mile drive home.

Granite Peak, MT, 12,799 ft. – August 18, 2012, HP #13:  The prospect that Granite Peak would not be in reach this trip settled in hard on us.
I woke up at 3:00 am August 17, 2012 about 45 minutes earlier then I needed to, but sleep wouldn’t return. As planned I left the house at 4:30 am and drove up to Peter’s place. From there we got into his truck and drove North 450 miles through Utah and Yellowstone to Cook City, Montana where we had lunch. 
By 2:07 pm we were on the Lady of the Lakes trail thinking we’d make it to Lone Elk Lake between 6 and 6:30 pm. Our goal for the outing was to climb 12,799 ft. high Granite Peak of the Beartooth Mountains and the high point of Montana.  We would be in the wilderness for three days and two nights.  Where we parked seemed to be an old abandoned sawmill, and there was a lot of scrap metal parts etc. rusting and lying around.
The walking was quick and before we knew it the trail had faded away, and we were wondering if we’d missed a turn. A quick look at the map showed that all we had to do was head due north, so we continued north ignoring the feeling that we weren’t on route. By 5pm we reached a lake at the top of a steep hill, and we wondered why it wasn’t on the map, but the map was of poor quality and it looked like there might be a blue spot under the blue trail line so we kept on walking. As we rounded the east side of the lake we encountered another hiker and he seemed to confirm that Lower Aero Lake was to the North East about an hour’s hike away. So we tried to go north east, but we couldn’t find the lake. 
Finally we had to accept that we had messed up, and the prospect that Granite Peak would not be in reach this trip settled in hard on us. What a disappointment! Where had we gone wrong was the question we mulled over and over for hours as we back tracked to the Lake and then down the hill in the dark. By 10:00 pm, we found a good camp spot near Zimmer Creek and we stopped. Now with the peak out of our reach we hoped, tomorrow, to at least find Aero Lake and discover how and where we had gone wrong.

Within 30 minutes we were back down to the intersection of Zimmer creek and Broadwater River. Next it was through the trees, on the south of the river, and then across the river, and we found a trail heading downstream, and we knew we were on route. By noon we reached Rough Lake, and there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, and we thought maybe, just maybe, we still had a chance of reaching the peak. So we continued up Sky Top creek and along the Sky Top Lakes and soon we spotted Granite Peak. One of the smaller Sky Top lakes just west of the big lower lake had a remarkable Carlg snowfield along its edge.
By 2:00 pm we found a camp spot, at roughly 10,400 feet and by 3:00 pm, with lighter loads, we were aiming for the peak. It didn’t take more than 30 minutes to reach the head of the large Sky Top Lake, and shortly after we encountered a man and woman heading down. We asked them about the south west couloir route, and we were snapped at by the woman who said “if you don’t know where you are going, we shouldn’t help you”. I returned her rudeness by impolitely waving her off as the man proceeded to chat with us. We hoped to reach the slab, on the face of the mountain, by 5:00 pm, but the walking was slow over miles and miles of boulders. 
Peter stared to feel the altitude and by 5:00 pm he told me to just go ahead and try to reach the peak, and that he would follow along at his own pace.  We arranged a meeting place as well should he opt to not continue.  Feeling guilty about separating I recognized I had to go for it, setting myself a turnaround time of 7:00 pm at the latest. By 5:30 pm I had traversed the base of the slab and was looking up the south west couloir, and up I went. It was all but snow free, and my ice axe wasn’t needed.  At 6:15 pm I reached a point that was stout class 4. Worried about the return down climb I searched for an easier way and after trying three different ways up I just about turned around. But then something told me to give it one more go, and up I went reaching the summit ridge by 6:25 pm and the peak by 6:30 pm. 
Out came the camera, snap, snap. Next I signed the summit log, and had a bite to eat. By 6:55 pm I started down. Just off the ridge a 3 foot wide chunk of rock broke out from under me, luckily I had two good hand holds, and went zooming down as I yelled “rock, rock” over and over. I prayed Peter wasn’t below it.  I made it back to my trekking pole about 50 feet up the couloir at 7:31 pm.  I had left the pole there with a piece of orange webbing tied to it as a guide for Peter to spot from the mouth of the couloir.
By 7:40 pm I was out of the couloir and skirting along the slab. By 8:00 pm I spotted Peter at our arranged meeting point on the moraine at the base of the peak, and a few minutes later I joined him. It wasn’t until 10:38 pm that we finally wandered back into camp. Finding the camp in the dark, had been yet another test. We’d been hiking for 14.5 hours! Exhausted I lay on the ground and asked Peter to take my photo. After a few snacks we laid down in the tent and slept.
Next morning I was up at 6:15 am with an upset stomach, and by 8:15 am we were marching out. By 9:00 am we reached Rough Lake, and by 9:45 am Lone Elk Lake was behind us. There were a lot of mountain goats on the ridges east of Lone Elk Lake.  At 11:00 am we stopped along the Sky Top creek, and soaked our sore feet as we ate some snacks. By 12:45 pm we were back at the intersection of Broadwater River and Zimmer creek, were we instantly realized how we missed the right turn the day before. Someone had blocked the right fork of the trail with some logs and so we had gone left, and crossed the creek more to the west where the trail downhill along Broadwater River could not be seen. Our lesson learned - bring a better map, and plot a few way points! At 2:15 pm we reached the truck, plenty tried and with more than one sore muscle. We still had 450 miles of driving ahead of us, and by the time we got back to Peter's place we had been gone for 66 hours, with very little rest.
The day after returning home a glance at a terrain map showed were we had wandered off to Zimmer Lake about 2 - 2.5 miles from the turn off to Aero Lake, where the trail ended. From Zimmer Lake we’d gone up to the 11,000 foot south ridge of Mt. Wilse, wandering both south and east, adding at least another 1.5 miles. Overall we walked 8 miles extra from the turn off to Aero Lake. I'd also guess that from our first night camp spot to Broadwater River (aka Star Creek) was 1 to 1.5 miles. So over all we added around 11 miles to our trip.
In summary, day one we drove 450 miles then walked from 2pm till 10 pm, covering 12 or so miles (2,400 vertical feet -from 8,800 to 11,200 ft.). Day two we walked from 8:00 am till 10:38 pm covering around 16 miles and going up at least 4000 vertical feet.  I’m not sure how much we went up and down on day two but we started somewhere closed to 8,800 feet and went up to 12,799 ft. Day three we walked from 8:15 am till 2:15 am covering about 11 miles, and then drove 450 miles home.




Photo Description:

1.	August 17, 2012 we drove 450 miles from Utah to the Absaroka Beartooth Wilderness area of the Gallatin National Forest near Cooke City Montana.  Here is Peter at the Lady of the Lakes trailhead at 2:07 pm.  Our goal was to climb 12, 799 ft high Granite Peak of the Beartooth Mountains and the high point of Montana.  We would be in the wilderness for three days and two nights.  Where we parked seemed to be an old abandoned sawmill, and there was a lot of scrap metal parts etc rusting and lying around.
2.	It took us about 30 minutes to arrive at "Lady of the Lake" lake -- 1 mile from the trailhead.
3.	Day 1, we had planned to walk into either Lower Aero Lake or Lone Elk Lake, but we somehow over looked the turn offs to both and continued to follow the Zimmer Creek all the way to Zimmer Lake.  Here is the view south from the top of the Zimmer creek, where it comes out of Zimmer Lake, at about 10, 085 ft.  5:21 pm.  We sort of realized we were off track, but when we chatted with another hiker at the Lake he seemed to confirm that we could get to Aero Lake by going NE.  Our map was on too small of a scale to be useful, poor planning on our part!
4.	From Zimmer Lake we wander around for more than 3 hours getting up to 11,200 feet on the south ridge of Mt. Wilse, but we could not catch a glimpse of either of the Aero Lakes.  With limited day light, we back tracked back to Zimmer Lake, and paused for dinner here at 8:41 pm as the sun set. The realization that Granite Peak would not be in reach this trip settled in hard on us. What a disappointment! Where had we gone wrong was the question we mulled over and over for hours.  After dinner we back track down from the lake and followed the creek, stopping at 10:00 pm to camp.
5.	Day 2, we located the Broadwater river, which would lead us to sky top creek which in turn would lead us to Lone Elk Lake, Rough Lake, and the Sky top lakes (just below Granite Peak).  Here Peter is crossing the creek that comes out of Lower Aero Lake and enters Skytop creek.  9:40 am.  We started hiking on day 2 at about 8 am.  Elevation here is about 9,200 feet.
6.	Here is Peter approaching Lone Elk Lake at 11:07 am.  About 10,040 ft.
7.	Wild flowers at Lone Elk Lake.
8.	At noon, we stopped at Rough Lake (seen here).  Looking west over the lake, the peak might be Mt. Wilse, who's south ridge we had been on the day before.  Rough Lake is at 10,145 ft.
9.	From Rough Lake we wandered up the creek, and here I am on the west side of the first Sky Top Lake at 1:04 pm.  Our destination of Granite Peak can be seen in the picture.
10.	One of the smaller Sky Top lakes just west of the big lower lake had a nice calving "glacier". The jagged looking peak on the right top is named "The Spires".
11.	A close up on the calving "glacier"
12.	Peter, at 1:18 pm.
13.	Peter, at 1:18 pm.
14.	Me
15.	Me
16.	Peter.  We tried to stay on the left of the sky top lakes.
17.	In the creek between a couple of the smaller Sky Top Lake, 10, 400 ft, we stopped to get water.
18.	1:45 pm, getting water.
19.	Around 2:00 pm we crossed this snow field, and then stopped at the lake it feed to set up our camp.
20.	2:48 pm, Peter at Day 2 camp spot.  Photo looks south with point 10,952 ft clearly seen at top right.  Our camp was roughly at 10,400 ft.
21.	3:17 pm, almost at the north end of the big Sky Top Lake.  Granite Peak above Walter's head and to the right.
22.	Granite Peak at 4:16 pm.
23.	4:30 pm, Peter entering the snowfield where we got water.  The Spires mountain seen behind him.
24.	Around 4.45pm Peter said he would continue at his own pace and that I should go ahead. I made it to the mouth of the SW couloir at 5:30 pm and took this photo looking mostly south. The lakes are the Sky Top Lakes.
25.	A look up the Couloir.
26.	The Sky Top Glacier, as seen looking West out of the SW Couloir at 5:51 pm
27.	At 6:24 pm I made it on to a south ridge, from which I would turn right (east) to gain the peak.  At 6:15 pm I almost turned around because I had a tough time finding a passage over a class 4 section and was concerned about down climbing it on the descent.
28.	The U.S Geological Survey Bench Marker, dated 1958.  6:30 pm at 12, 799 ft (the high point of Montana).  The ice-axe was not used, but I had been advised to bring it by a guy on summitpost that I had email that had climbed it recently.
29.	Self Portrait
30.	At 6:32 pm I signed the summit log book.
31.	Another self-portrait on the summit.
32.	I left the summit at 6:55 pm, and made it back to my trekking pole about 50 feet up the couloir at 7:31 pm.  I had left the pole there with a piece of orange webbing tied to it as a guide for Peter to spot from the mouth of the couloir.
33.	At 7:42 pm I exited the couloir.  It had taken 47 minutes to descend from the peak to this point.
34.	8:12 pm I joined back up with Peter.   Notice the black spot on the slab at little higher than center in this photo, that is where you enter the couloir to the peak.
35.	At 10:38 pm we finally made it back to our camp.  Walking down in the dark was slow going.  I was exhausted from 14.5 hours of walking, and 8 hours of walking the day before. Day one we walked from 2pm till 10 pm, covering 12 or so miles (2,400 vertical feet -from 8,800 to 11,200 ft). Day two we walked from 8:00 am till 10:38 pm covering around 16 miles and going up at least 4000 vertical feet (not sure how much we went up and down, but we started somewhere closed to 8,800 feet and went up to 12,799 ft).
36.	At 10:38 pm we finally made it back to our camp.
37.	The view northish from our camp spot.  Notice the Sky Top Glacier, and Granite Peak.  Also notice the black bag with our food in it on the large boulder behind the tent.  Day 3, at 6:25 am.
38.	Photo looks south, from our camp, with point 10,952 ft clearly seen at top right.  August 19, 2012 at 6:27 am.
39.	At 8:10 am, we were packed up and ready to begin the 11 mile walk out.
40.	At 8:48 am Rough Lake came into view to the SW.  We made it to our lunch spot of the day before within an hour of hiking.
41.	Peter crossing Sky Top Creek below Lone Elk Lake at 9:45 am.
42.	There were a lot of mountain goats on the ridges east of Lone Elk Lake.
43.	At 10:30 am we passed through this meadow of wild flowers growing along Sky Top creek.
44.	By 1:30 pm we had almost made it to the lower end of Lady of the Lake.
45.	About 30 minutes from the end there is this sign.  We made it back to the truck at 2:15 pm, having walked for 7 hours.  We still had 450 miles of driving ahead of us!!  By the time we got back to Peter's place we had been gone for 66 hours.
46.	A huge cable at the abandoned saw mill where we parked.
47.	Based on the size of this chimney there might have been a larger home here at one time.  Near the abandoned sawmill.
