Gannett Peak, Wyoming's High Point.
A group of seven of us bagged this peak on August 19, 2009.  It's a long approach into this peak so to conserve energy we took two days to hike into the upper Titcomb Lake, where we basically set up our "base" camp.  From our base camp to the top of Bonney Pass took us just under 2 hours.  From Bonney Pass to the bergschrund took another 2.5 hours.  From the bergschrund to the peak took about 1.25 hours.  Total ascent time from our base camp was 5 hours 45 minutes.  Day 4 four we walked out covering, in reverse, what we had covered on days 2 and 1 respectively.
