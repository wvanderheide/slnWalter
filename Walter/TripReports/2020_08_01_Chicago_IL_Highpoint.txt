July 30, 2020 – Ana and I picked up Peter, from his house in Sandy at 7:15 am.  He rode to the airport with us then drove Ana’s car to his house.  We fly on Delta to Chicago directly.  Our motel, Holiday Inn, was located a block from the airport car rental facility so we use the rental car shuttle service then walked to the motel arriving just before 3pm.  They allow us to check in immediately.  We check out the room, and then walked less than a mile to Target to pick up some groceries. Our motel was located in Rosemont, about 45 mins, via train, from downtown, so we opted to just relax at the motel all evening.
July 31, we spent the day in Chicago looking around.  We took the car rental shuttle back to the airport in the morning and from terminal one we caught the Blue Line Subway train to the city.  Our Hop on Hop Off bus tour was cancelled due to Covid 19 so I had Ana install an App on her phone a few days before our trip to guide us on a walking tour.  I had a backup map in case she screwed that up, and of course she did.  First I located the Chicago Architecture center at 111 E Wacker Drive (which I kept calling the Jeffery Epstein drive – hahaha), so I would know where it was for our Sunday tour we had scheduled.  Next we found the Magnificent Mile, and walked up to the Chicago Water Tower building 1869. From there we wandered east over to Lake Michigan where we used the public restroom at Lake Shore Park en route. I touched the water of Lake Michigan as we next wandered along its paved shore over to the Navy Pier with its Ferris wheel.  From there we found the NBC building, and supplemented the lunch we were carrying with a few things from Whole Foods.  
After lunch we walked to Millennium Park via the seedy under passes of Columbus Drive (where saw a freak black guy on a drug trip) and got our photo at Cloud Gate (the elliptical sculpture that looks like a shiny steel bean) – thought it was cool how it reflects the city buildings around it.  Following that we took the Green line to Cermak-McCormick Place and walked over to Chinatown.  We picked up a few souvenirs in Chinatown then took the red line to 47th street where we hoped to get a bus to 5040 S Greenwood Ave (Obama Family home) but it was a bad neighborhood and we had a long wait for the bus, and I decided it wasn’t worth the wait and all that might go wrong.  Back on the red line to the Jackson stop and located the Willis Tower (aka Sears Town) as we had a sky deck/ledge tour booked for 6:30pm.  With that located we had time to kill so we checked out Union Station, then had dinner at Giordano’s on Jackson Blvd. The deep dish pizza was awesome.  After dinner we relaxed at the garden  across the street, to the south on Jackson Blvd, of the Sears Tower until it was time to go up to the sky deck at 6:15pm.  We were tired so having to wait in line, in spite of your reservation, was a bit frustrating – I didn’t mind but Ana did and that bugged the crap out of me.   We took the elevator to the 99th floor, where we got photos of the city, then we had to wait in line to take another elevator to the 103rd floor for “The Ledge” – a glass balcony extending four feet outside the Tower.  Ana was scared to walk on the glass floor of the balcony.
We took the Quincy station orange line to Clark/Lake then the Blue Line to O’Hara. Must have been around 9pm when we arrived at the airport and we had to wait 20 mins or more for the car rental shuttle bus.  We were the only ones on the that bus, and he didn’t stop to pick up others at terminal 2 and the he took a different route  to the rental car drop off – it felt weird but it worked out.
Sunday I had a Budget car reserved for 7:30 pm, but similar to Minneapolis a week weeks earlier the line to pick up the car was huge and it took an hour before I got it.  From there we drove 150 miles (2.5 hours) via I-90 and US 20 to Charles Mound highest point in Illinois.   The owners of Charles Mound, Wayne and Jean Wuebbels, make you walk in on a farming track about a mile.  Charles Mound is an actual hill, not just a flat spot like Hawkeye or Panorama Point which I didn’t expect.   There were a lot of cars parked along the road when we arrived an hour behind schedule due to the delay getting the car.  And as we walked up the overgrown road several groups were coming down and one lone hiker passed us has he hiked up.  Lots of corn farming at the Wuebbels and the area in general.  We arrived on top to just the lone hiker who past us, and then after a while a couple guys appeared from the grass just past the highpoint.  There were two chairs at the highpoint which we used after the lone hiker left.  We mostly had the place to ourselves.  The weather was nice, no bugs around, and the views north were open and nice.  Just after we signed the summit register, another couple arrived and asked to sign it.  We gave them the chairs and after they left we moved the chairs into the shade and enjoyed the view for a while longer.  When the next group arrived we headed down by walking on the grass where we saw the two guys mentioned above, and in so doing we saw the Wuebbels house.
It is interesting to note that the Sears Tower in Chicago rises 1,450 feet, and has a ground elevation of 583 feet. That puts the top of the Sears Tower at an elevation of 2,033 feet above sea level, nearly 800 feet higher than the natural highpoint of Charles Mound.  Anyways, we visited both highpoints (manmade and natural) on this trip.
On the hike back to the car we saw just a couple other parties headed up.  Nevertheless there were still a lot of cars on the road, many more than there were hikers around and I found that strange as there was no other apparent reason to be there.
From the highpoint of Illinois we drove the 12 miles or so to the historic tourist attraction town of Galena.  Lots of white folks around not wearing COVID19 masks.  We got lucky and got a decent parking spot, so we walked down the main street and saw all the white people eating lunch and drinking alcohol.  I am not a fan of places like this. We walked up the step staircase to the High School, but there were too many trees for a good view.  Ana spazzed out when I asked her to close the door behind her at the first store we entered.  Overall she did pretty good on this trip with not spazzing out all the time, but she was still annoying giving off the vibe that she was just following me around cluelessly and not contributing anything to the experience.  Next I drove us past Ulysses Grants home, and the rich dude who helped him out.
When we reached Bloomington on US 20 I stopped to find a rest room.  We got back on 39 but with the road construction we didn’t see a 39 S sign for a few miles, and we needed 39 N, so we did a few extra miles.  When we got back to Rosemont, we first went for dinner, then I dropped Ana at the motel, and I returned the car.  The return when quickly and smoothly, and I was back to the motel before 7:30 pm.  By 9pm I was very tired and went to sleep quickly.
August 2, up early again, and by 7:30 am we checked a bag at the front desk and checked out of the motel.  We used the motel shuttle to go to the airport and took the subway into Chicago.  We had a 10:30 am Architecture walking tour, and we arrived in the city by 8:30 am.  We walked along the Chicago river, then attempted to ride the orange line L (elevated) train but that didn’t work out.  At 10 am we checked in for the tour, then checked out the Architecture center museum until 10:30 am.  
A father/daughter (I think) from Brooklyn, and a 20 something girl from Chicago were the only others on the tour.  Tour size was limited to 6 from the usual 20 due to the pandemic. A retired woman led the walking tour.  And we learned out the fort that used to be a Michigan and E. Wacker street, then we leader a black French man from the Caribbean was the first settler prior to the fort (I think), and he had a trading post on the river next to where the fort would go.  Our tour guide said Chicago means stinky onion for the wild onions that used grow along the river banks.  Next she talked about the fire and other events that led up to skyscrapers (any building over 6 floors).  We looked at some original skyscrapers with their internal frames of iron or steel. We looked at a few Art Deco towers. Next we compared those to the much taller “modern” ones with the non-ornate design and exposed steel frames, with many more floors (the buildings of the 1960 and 1970s).  We compared those to post-modern structures like the NBC building.  And finally we saw some current day skyscrapers. The tour was 1.5 hours. After Ana and I ate our apples and other snacks then returned to the Architecture center to check out the second floor of the museum which talked about skyscrapers around the world.  We were still hungry so we went looking for a quick place to eat, needing to catch the subway back to O’Hare before 2pm.  En route we looked inside the Motor Club building which is Art Deco as we didn’t go inside any buildings on the tour due to COVID19.  Prior, we also peaked inside the lobby Virgin Hotel (what an oxymoron), and I wasn’t impressed how much they were pushing their dog-friendliness. 
It was tough to find an open place for lunch, and we had to back track to a sandwich shop to do so.  No open restroom and only takeout orders, but we managed to catch the subway before 2pm.  Returning to the motel, picking up the bag, and returning to the airport went smooth as the motel shuttle arrived shortly after we did, and we just did a loop on it with the drive picking up our bag when we reached the motel.  
Checking into our Delta flight was also not busy, and when we walked up to TSA there was on other travelers there – how rare.  With the commute from the city and getting past TSA all going smoothly we had more than 2 hours to wait for our plane which we would have liked to have used that time at a nice lunch in the city.  
The flight home was delayed on the runway for about 20 mins.  Peter and Kathryn in Ana’s car picked us up and it was still hot at 9pm in Utah with the heat wave going on.  At Peters he showed us his almost finished remodeled kitchen that he did himself.  Looks great.
Slow drive from Sandy to Orem due to I-15 construction.  It was after 11pm when I had showered and was ready for bed, exhausted.
