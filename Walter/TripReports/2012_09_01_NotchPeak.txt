September 1, 2012 Ana Serrano and I hiked up to the top of Notch Peak (9654 ft) located about 50 miles east of the Utah/Nevada border, and about 50 miles west of Delta, Utah, in Utah’s west desert.  The reason to hike this peak is to see it cliff faces. The north facing cliff falls over 4450 feet to the drainage in the valley floor below, making it the tallest cliff in the USA.  Looking down the cliff it feels as though the face is vertical for its entirety, but the pure vertical portion is 2200 ft.  In comparison El Capitan in Yosemite has a pure vertical drop of 3000 ft, and the largest purely vertical drop on the plant is 4,500 ft down the face of Mount Thor on Baffin Island, Canada.

Notch Peak forms a cirque, which opens to the North West (mostly west), and includes point 9424 ft, 36 degrees to the North East from the high point. The drop from point 9424 is what is viewed from the high point and is over 4200 feet.  At its top, the widest place, the cirque is about 1 km wide, and appears to be just a creek bed wide at the bottom.

The hike begins at about 6700 ft, and covers about 4.5 miles to the peak.  There is a saddle between point 9320 ft (directly east of the true summit).  Following a canyon left branching from the main Sawtooth canyon we arrived at the saddle after 2.5 hours of walking.  To the northwest we could see the black thunder and lightning clouds rolling our way, and new the storm would soon be upon us.  We snapped a few picture before the storm rolled in, and then watched the cirque fill with white clouds , as we retreated into the Bristlecone forest on the east side of point 9320. Clear colored hail and rain fell as we huddled under one of the potentially 5000 year old trees, and ate our lunches.  After approximately an hour, there was a break in the storm and we set off fast hoping to reach the peak before anymore lightening.  

By 1pm we had nowhere higher to go, but if we continued north we had almost a mile drop in our path.  What an awesome sight to behold!  As we snapped a few pictures, and looked around, it seemed that all around us, expect for directly above the peak, were dark thunder clouds.  We didn’t think our luck would hold out long so we retreated quickly.  However just a few minutes’ walk below the peak the storm seemed to subside more, so we turned around, and went back to the top to enjoy the views more in a less threatening environment.
