October 17, 2020 I took a Jet Blue flight from SLC via Las Vegas to Columbus Ohio, arriving around 6 pm as the CMH airport was closing (how awesome is that?).  I had my motel come and pick me up, and after I got checked in, I walked across the street and got a sandwich.
October 18, I returned to the airport at 7:30 am to pick up my rental car but Budget didn’t open until 8 am.  I was first in line to get a car and so that went quickly.  By 9:30 am I had driven to Campbell Hill in Bellefontaine at the old Cold War site now a vocational school. A cop was parked at the school gate so I drove by, and as I turned around to go back and in another car turned in which I felt was a fellow highpointer (and he was).  He got to the nicely down area around the benchmark, and I saw him take a selfie.  I offer to take his photo, but he said no thanks but did agree to take my picture.  We chatted a bit about our high pointing history, and he was impressed that I had all the tough ones down.  He had just been to Indiana highpoint already that morning.  He soon left and I had the place to myself and took many more photos.

•	Campbell Hill Ohio as seen from highway OH-540 (Sandusky Ave) looking south. At only 1550 ft this hill, is borderline to being just a simple landmark.  A former cold war site which is now some type of vocational school.
•	The Hill – highpoint is near the pine trees.
•	Notice the flag pole obscured by the pine trees that is where the highpoint is on this hill.  I visited it the morning of October 18, 2020 and it was my 43rd US State Highpoint.
•	Ohio Hi-Point career center it says….
•	Inside the visitor registration was a certificate which you take and add your name and date to signifying the accomplishment of visiting the highest point in Ohio.
•	The highpoint is nicely done up.
•	Read it
•	I arrived at the same time as a fellow highpointer who took this photo of and for me.  He didn't want me to return the favor.
•	Approaching the survey marker.
•	Marker
•	Ditto
•	HP bench
•	Look back at the photo of me at the sign, and you will notice these painted rocks at it's base.
•	Cold war, BS.
•	I liked the "top of ohio" label on this silo thing.
•	Inside the visitor registration was this certificate which I added my name and date to signifying the accomplishment of visiting the highest point in Ohio.
