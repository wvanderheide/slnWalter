September 6, 2008, Dave Jones and I climbed Broads Fork Twin Peaks in the Wasatch-cache National Forest.  
We ascended via the standard Broads Fork trail to the saddle (10,800 ft) between Sunrise Peak and the East Twin Peak. 
It took about four hours to reach the saddle. From the Saddle we reached the East Twin Peak (11,330 ft) within an hour. 
The ascent was a challenging route which involved over 5,000 vertical feet of elevation gain, and an exposed 3rd class scramble.

There were four other hikers on the east peak so we continued on to the lower (11,328 ft) west summit.  After 
resting and eating on the west summit, we returned to the east summit where there was now only one hiker, and we 
saw another hiker ascending the north ridge.  Speaking with the lone hiker and the north ridge hiker (when she reached 
the east peak) we decided to desend via the north ridge (this route is known as the Robinson Variation).  On the return we summited 
the so-called false peak, and then turned east and down to the lake.  The return route was much more challenging, but worth doing 
to take in the extra peak.  We started hiking at 7am, and where done 10.5 hours later!
