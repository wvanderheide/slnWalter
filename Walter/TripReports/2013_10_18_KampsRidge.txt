October 18, 2013 – William DaBell and I attempted Kamps Ridge.  We got a late start (9:30 am-ish).  We reached Kamps ridge by noon.  By the time we roped up, and had a bite to eat at was 12:30 pm.  We climbed 3 long pitches, and with route finding woes that took till 4:30 pm.  We had to start down as it looked like we still had quite a ways to go.  By 5:30 pm we were off the first rappel – done with a single 60 m rope.  Next we did two double length rope rappels (with walking in between) which got us to our lunch spot – the same spot Chris P and I had gotten to in the summer.  Rappelled down the west side in the dark having reached the last rappel at 7 pm just as the sun was going down.  Got back to the cars at 9:30 pm.  Need a warmer, longer daylight day for Kamps ridge!
