April 26, 2013 I drove from Orem Utah to the four corners (Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and 
Colorado). From there I made my way to Farmington, NM, and then to Taos ski resort. I 
slept in the back of my SUV, and the next morning I woke up at 4:00 am and by 5 am I was 
hiking the Bull of the Woods trail en route to Mt. Walter (13133 ft), and Wheeler Peak 
(13161 ft) the highest peaks in NM. I had to do a little route finding, and the occasional 
stop, but it took 4.5 hours to cover the 3,660+ vertical feet and 8 miles to Mt. Walter. 
It was only another 20 minutes to Wheeler Peak. I descended to Williams lake in about 
45 minutes and was back to the ski resort by 11:30 am. Then I had an hour walk on the 
gravel road back to my car. Later that evening I drove to Taos, and then through Durango, 
Co to near Cortez where I camped in the National Forest.  Next day I arrived in Moab and 
road the slick rock trail, and drove over the Baby Lions Back.
