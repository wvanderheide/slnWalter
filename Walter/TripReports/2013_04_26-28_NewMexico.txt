Wheeler Peak, NM, 13,161 ft. – April 27, 2013, HP #14:  A few cars over took me as marched down the gravel, but they all ignored my thumb asking for a ride.
Undoubtedly, by this this point in time I was making a conscientious effort to reach state high points.  As such April 26, 2013 I drove unaccompanied from Orem to New Mexico’s Taos ski resort. On the way I swung by the four corners where I did my best inverted crab pose, aka a hybrid wheel pose, so I could be in four US states at once – one hand in Colorado, the other in New Mexico, with my feet in Utah and Arizona separately.
Next it was on to Farmington, NM where I purchased a few supplies for the trip and finally to Taos ski resort. Northwest of Taos, along highway 64, after passing through the Apache Nation Reservation, I encountered an Earthship home.  I don’t recall if this was before or after crossing the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge the second highest bridge on the U.S. Highway System – but it was probably before.  
The ski resort allows free over-night camping parking in their upper lot so I took advantage of that sleeping in the back of my SUV. The next morning I woke up at 4:00 am and by 5:00 am I was hiking the Bull of the Woods trail en route to Mt. Walter (13133 ft.), and its neighbor Wheeler Peak (13161 ft.) the two highest peaks in New Mexico.  I had to do a little route finding, and I made the occasional stop, so it took 4.5 hours to cover the 3,660+ vertical feet and 8 miles to Mt. Walter.  I spooked some bighorn sheep along the way.
It was pretty cool to find a summit sign on Mt. Walter, as it is not every day you get stand on a mountain that shares a name with you, shame it was not his last name.  The sign read, “MT. WALTER, ELEV. 13,141 FT., NAMED FOR H. D. WALTER, WHO LOVED THESE MOUNTAINS” and it made me smile.  
It was only another 20 minutes to the highest point of New Mexico, Wheeler Peak.  From here the ski slopes of Taos are only a mile and a quarter away as the crow flies.  This peak used to be called Taos Peak, meaning “place of red willows” but in 1950 it was changed to its current name in honor of the leader of the Wheeler Survey.  There is a plaque on top, mounted above a cannon type pipe of some sorts, mentioning he lead the survey for ten years.  Walter and Wheeler lie in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains (Spanish for "Blood of Christ").  Perhaps alpenglow led to the name of this range which extends into Colorado.
As I headed down, I decided to make my excursion into a loop hike, turning left (west) between the two peak. With everything still covered in snow I down climbed and glissaded to Williams Lake in about 45 minutes. In another 30 minutes, heading north, I arrived at the south end of the ski resort by 11:30 am. Then I had an hour walk on the Twinning road back to my SUV in the Coyote parking lot at the north end of the resort.  A few cars over took me as marched down the gravel, but they all ignored my thumb asking for a ride.  
Later that evening I drove to Taos, and then through Durango, Co to near Cortez where I camped in the National Forest.  Next day I arrived in Moab and road the slick rock trail on my mountain back, and drove my SUV over Baby Lions Back before returning home.

April 26, 2013 I drove from Orem Utah to the four corners (Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and 
Colorado). From there I made my way to Farmington, NM, and then to Taos ski resort. I 
slept in the back of my SUV, and the next morning I woke up at 4:00 am and by 5 am I was 
hiking the Bull of the Woods trail en route to Mt. Walter (13133 ft), and Wheeler Peak 
(13161 ft) the highest peaks in NM. I had to do a little route finding, and the occasional 
stop, but it took 4.5 hours to cover the 3,660+ vertical feet and 8 miles to Mt. Walter. 
It was only another 20 minutes to Wheeler Peak. I descended to Williams lake in about 
45 minutes and was back to the ski resort by 11:30 am. Then I had an hour walk on the 
gravel road back to my car. Later that evening I drove to Taos, and then through Durango, 
Co to near Cortez where I camped in the National Forest.  Next day I arrived in Moab and 
road the slick rock trail, and drove over the Baby Lions Back.
