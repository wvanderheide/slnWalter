August 16 2019 Peter and Ryan came over at 9:00 am and I drove us to the Unitas to Blacks Fork so we could hike into Tokewanna Peak.  See my 2016 doc labeled Tokewanna Peak_2016.docx.

We drove FR 64 to it’s terminus.  In 2016 we drove 1 mile of the 2-mile-long FR 64.  There are three boggy spots half way down FR 64, and a few very rough sections.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to continue on it after we got through the first two bogs so we parked and got ready for the hike.  Two trucks came by as we prepared and one asked us if we were there to hunt - apparently the next day was opening bow hunting season.  He also told me the road didn’t improve.  We started walking around 1pm only to find that the road did improve, so I left my pack, ran back and got the truck then picked up my pack along with Peter and Ryan and we drove to the real trailhead to a much safer parking spot.  The truck we talked to had a big camp set up at the trailhead, and the other truck was parked in the trees with the owner getting his gear ready to go hunting.  

1.	The huge meadow at the beginning of the hike, with Tokewanna behind Peter and Ryan at 1:40pm.
2.	We arrive the lake at 10,934 ft around 5:40 pm, I guess the hike in was 9 miles (seemed like less).  There is only a trail for about half of that.  The trail goes to the waterfall, but peters out now and then on that section, after the waterfall we just followed the west side of the creek until we got into big trees, then we headed SW, mostly west, to our camp spot at the lake.
3.	August 17 I was up with the sun around 6:30 am, and we got out of camp by 8:30 am.  Ryan at 8:51 am east side of the Upper Lake as we get near the ridge.This year we used the north east ridge of Tokewanna to access the peak.  In 2016 Peter and I hiked first to Bobs Lake then approached from the west of the peak.  
4.	I reached the peak at 10:20am, Peter and Ryan arrived at the same time as a dark cloud at 11:05 am.  I ate my lunch on the peak, but with the dark cloud Peter and Ryan only had time for me to get a photo of them before we all headed down.
5.	10:57 am as Peter and Ryan reach the false summit and are only minutes from the peak.
6.	11:10 am Peter and Ryan on the descent
7.	Some snow remained on the north east end as we descend.
8.	I was wondering if one of these peaks to the east is Kings peak?
9.	Meeks reservoir to the north.
10.	I returned to camp around 12:30 pm.  Peter and Ryan stopped on the ridge for lunch.  I took this photo to see if I could see them, but I can’t.  They got back to camp around 1:15 pm.  We ate, rested, packed up and hiked out for about 2 hours or less to the southern most cabins of the logging ghost town, where we set up a camp for the night.  Around 9pm we heard a dog bark, and an injury type squeal come from the south of us.  I was camped a 50 yards away from the others, and we didn’t mention it to each other.  A while later a few yelps came from the north of us, and then a twig or something fell onto my tent.  I shown my light around, but didn’t hear anything react to that.  Around 11pm the fighting and howling got intense so I asked Peter what he thought it was and we discussed the prior barking etc.  We decided it was coyotes, very close, and fighting over a kill.  I got up, then Peter and Ryan got up and we moved my tent close to theirs (Peter had a tent, Ryan a bivy).  We also started up our fire, and tied Peters food up in the tree where mine was.  Our activity seemed to scare off the coyotes as we didn’t hear them again.
