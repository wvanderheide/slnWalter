    I've been keeping a journal off on and since high school.
    <br />
    <br />
    Up until 2014 they are all hand written.  During my mission to Adelaide I was very faithful in writing, then they are quite sporadic until I moved to Utah in 2005 when I again became quite regular in my updates.  In 2014 I switched to bullet points in Word docs, and that's what I list here.  As of today, July 9, 2018, I don't wish to load my journals into GitHub, but I do store them in email, back them up on my external drive, and have them on my computer (see Documents/Journal).

I started a thing on Facebook in 2013 where I put one (or two) pictures in an year album from each outing I do.  My journal bullet points are also by year, so if I provide a PHOTO link to say "2017 Overview" then the "trip report" for that should be my 2017 year journal.
