Sept 3, 2011 I left Orem around 5pm and drove through Evanston WY to the Henrys Fork Trailhead.  By 8:45 pm, in the dark, I was back packing into Elkhorn Crossing.  I crossed a few groups on their way out, but I doubt there was anyone else heading in at the time of the day.  I covered the 5.5 miles and had my tent set up by midnight.  

Sept 4, 2011 I woke up, without an alarm, before 5 am, and was on the trail en route to Kings Peak by 5:15 am.  I arrived at the base of the toilet bowl chute at 7:30 am, and managed to scale those 1,000 ft  in about one hour.  Within another hour (approx. 9:30am) I arrived at 13,528 ft , making me the first one on Kings Peak that day.  I enjoyed the views for about an hour, and had the place to myself the whole time.  

By 11:30 I was at 13, 512 ft on South Kings Peak.  I only spend 10 minutes or so on S. Kings from which I continued the traverse toward Peak 13,306 (2nd Gemini), and Peak 13,387 (1st Gemini aka "Painter Peak"). I hadn’t really planned to hike more than Kings and S. Kings, but the Gemini’s were so inviting.  En route I crossed paths with a fellow named Jake Case who was tagging S. Kings.  He caught up to me on his return from S. Kings so we hiked 2nd Gemini and 1st Gemini together, crossing 1st Gemini at 12:30 pm and reaching 2nd G by 1 pm where we parted ways.

I returned to the saddle between S Kings and 2nd G, and from there dropped down into Painter Basin, which was a bit sketchy at times with all the cliff bands.  Then it was a lot of up and down until I finally crossed over Gunsight Pass at 6:15 pm.  

After nearly 15 hours of marching, I made it back to Elk Horn Crossing and was in my sleeping bagging by 8:18 pm.

The next day I got up around 9 am, and took my time cooking breakfast and exploring around Elk Horn Crossing.  The old bridge over the creek must have been washed out as a new, less sturdy one, was now in place down by where the stream ford area is.  Before noon, I made a fire and burned all my garbage then finished packing up and stared the march out at noon.

I arrived at the turn off for Alligator lake by 1 pm, and decided to drop my pack and run up to the lake to see it.  Returning to my pack, I ate a granola bar, and finished off my water, and then continued the stroll back to the car arriving by 2:20 pm.
