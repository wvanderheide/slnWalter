Monday, November 11, 2013, I left the Y-Parking lot at 10:06 am, hiked up to the Y then up Slide Canyon to the top of Y-Mountain arriving on top at noon.  Ate lunch and texted a couple photos to Ana, and by 12:15 pm I was heading south bushwhacking toward Maple Mtn.  When I got down in the valley between the Y-Mtn and Maple Mtn I came across small bear tracks in the snow.  They were iced over (aka old) but seemed to be going the same way I was, and sure enough I crossed them several times en route to the peak of Maple Mtn.  Arrived on the high point of Maple at 2:00 pm, after a 15 minute break I headed down arriving at my car by 4pm.

Thursday November 14, 2013, I walked from my house (86 E 1450 S, Orem) to the top of the Y.  Had to stop at Uncle Sams Store en route, but with that time taken out, it took about 1 hour 45 minutes.  I left the top at 3:32 pm, in 25 minutes was at the parking lot, and by 4:31 had pasted Helium Halls and was to Canyon Road.  Past “Big Lots” on State St at 4:40 pm, and was up the hill passing “Out n Back” by 4:56pm.  Made it home at 5:12 pm – exactly 1 hour 40 minutes on the return walk.  Had a few hot spots but luckily no blisters, glad I wore the wool socks with my runners (runners were bad idea).
