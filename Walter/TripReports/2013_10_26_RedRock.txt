Oct 25, 2013 I meet up with Wayne Pullman and Aaron White at 1pm and we drove down to Nevada’s Red Rock Canyon.  Only the bad walk-in spots were open at the campground, but luckily we met this guy from Washington State (Russ) who was nice enough to share his regular camp spot with us.  Next day Wayne, Aaron and I climbed the Olive Oil route, it was listed at 7 pitches but we did it in 3 pitches.  I wanted to do another route, but the others seemed to be done so we checked out the visitors center, and then relaxed at a park in Summerlin(?).

Oct 27, we got an early start and were the first ones on Johnny Vegas route on Lower Solar Slab.  Following that we climbed the Solar Slab Route on the Upper Tier, and walked out down Oak Creek Canyon.  Twelve hours car-to-car and over 1600 vertical feet of roped climbing (the most I have done in a day).

1.	Aaron White and Walter VanderHeide hiking into Rose Tower from the Pine Creek trail head in search of the Olive Oil Route to its peak at 8 am Oct 26, 2013.  The red capped mountain in front of these must be Juniper Peak.
2.	Trees grow near the banks of the creek flowing out of the canyon to the south of Mescalitio, which is all but dry this time of the year.
3.	Walter and Aaron with Mescalitio on the right side.
4.	The start of the Olive Oil route on Rose Tower.  With a party of three in front of us we didn’t start climbing till around 10 am.
5.	The climb is listed as 7 pitches but we ran out the 60m rope on every pitch and even simul-climbed a bit on our first pitch and as such we completed it in 3 pitches.  Here Walter is coming up 3rd on the first pitch.

27.	Aaron topping out on P3 (which had a tough slab section that Wayne lead).
28.	Once on the upper tier of Solar Slab we took the Solar Slab route.  We did the 9 pitch (1200 vertical feet) climb in six pitches, allowing us each to lead two.  Doing both the lower and upper tiers in one day was tiring as it was over 1600 vertical feet of roped climbing, and we walked off (long). Here Walter is coming up the 3rd pitch which Wayne lead.
