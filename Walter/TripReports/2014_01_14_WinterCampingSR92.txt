Jan 14, 2014 – I picked up Jared Ogden from the AF front runner station at 10:30 am.  We drove up AF canyon just past Mutual Dell where the road, SR 92, is blocked for winter which is just past mile marker 14.  I rigged up my sled, while he strapped his skis to his pack.  I brought skins for my skis and snowshoes for Jared – although the road was packed we still used the skins and snowshoes.  About 2 miles up the road, just past the entrance to Altamont campground, we paused for a break and this older guy caught up to us.  I noticed he had a Mountain Equipment Co-op back pack so I asked him if he was from Canada.  Turns out his name is Erwin (or Edwin) Ortley, and his brother Max lives in Cardston.  Max’s wife is Diane Ortley and she is a former mayor of Cardston.  He walked with us up as far as Salamander flat (about 1 mile from Altamont and just under 3 miles from the parking area), and we continued on up to the peak of the road which is 4 miles from the parking area.  We found a place out of view to camp, and set up.  Then we skied down to Salamander Flat as Erwin had said we could get water there – however we found it to be dried up.  So we skied down to the creek by Altamont, and then hiked back up the two miles to our camp.  Jared made a fire to warm up his tin-foil dinner while I boiled water for a freeze dried meal.  

Jared had planned to sleep in a bivy bag, but he found it was too tight with his sleeping pad inside, so I offered a spot in my tent.  He was also glad to join me in the tent, as there were coyotes howling close by.  We both stayed warm, but our water froze.

After breakfast, we found fresh coyote tracks  about 10 yards from our camp, so we attempted to follow them, but soon gave it up as the snow was to sugary to support our weight, and we only had the one pair of snowshoes.  Around 11 am, we were packed up and ready to ski out.  It only took about 20 minutes to ski the 4 miles back to the car.  En route, Jared stopped to get water at the creek by Altamont, which he wanted to take home to his parents.

I drove Jared back to Herriman to his parents’ house and he invited me in for lunch.  I chatted with his mom and dad as Jared made us pizza.  By 3:00 pm I drove home.
