June 23, 2012 I picked up Jared Ogden from his parents place in Herriman Utah at 5:15 am.  We drove west on I-80 to Wendover, then south on Highway 93 for about 28 miles.   From there it was gravel roads through the Ghost Town of Golden Hill, and on to Granite Creek.  En route we stopped at a Pony Express station landmark. Once through the first creek crossing of Granite Creek, the road required a 4X4 vehicle with clearance.  We made drove all the way to the where the road is barricaded (6,837 ft) and only had to put it in 4 wheel drive once.  

By 10:40 am we were walking passed the barricade heading North Easterly (mostly east) up the Granite Creek Valley between Red Mountain and Ibapah.   It took us about 3 hours to reach a meadow at 10,000+ feet, at the base of Red Mountain and Ibapah.  From the meadow up to the Ibapah ridge near the false summit was a scramble, without a trail, which we covered in less than an hour.  Once we skirted the false summit we paused for a lunch break at about 2:45 pm.  By 3:15 pm we reached the peak.  It took us under 4.5 hours to cover the 5,250 vertical feet (and six miles) to the 12,087 ft high peak.  

We spent about an hours on top, soaking in the views and taking pictures.  As we about to leave, a couple we had encountered with scrambling to the ridge arrived. So we chatted and took some more pictures. It was then I noticed the summit log book, so we signed it.

We left the peak at 4:25 pm and arrived at the trailhead around 7:45 pm.  We drove down to the creek, and found a wonderful camp spot.  Cleaned up, cooked, and slept.

Next morning we scrambled up one of the many rock formation near our camp.  On the drive home we stopped at the Bonneville Salt Flats.

•	5081 - The Pony Express Station located between Gold Hill and Granite Creek. June 23, 2012.
•	5082 - Ibapah is the "silver" looking peak in the center.  At this point we were about an hour drive away from the trailhead.  This view is looking SW.
•	5083 - Jared at the trailhead at about 10:40 am, June 23, 2012.  The trail travels mostly East and North East up the Granite Creek Valley to a meadow between Red Mountain and Ibapah.  The trailhead elevation is 6,837 feet.
•	5084 - There were a lot of interesting rock formation in the Granite Creek Valley.  The area prior to this very much resembled the City of Rocks in Idaho.
•	5085 - It took us about 3 hours to reach the meadow below Ibapah and Red Mountain.  At this point we would turn north (and even a bit NW) and headed up toward the false summit (the sparsely treed one in this pic).  The meadow elevation is 10,172 feet .  There was a steady creek up to this point of the hike.  We had climbed 3335 vertical feet, and had 1915 to go.
•	5086 - Jared on the scramble up to the false summit ridge line.  Red Mountain is clearly visible to the south behind him.  The meadow can also be seen (slightly right of center). 1:51 pm.
•	5087 - Looking east (slightly SE) from near the saddle between the false and true peaks.  The view is of the granite creek valley which we walked up.  At about 2:15 pm.
•	5089 - Jared with the summit of Ibapah to the NE behind him.  2:20 pm.
•	5090 - Along the ridge between the true and false summits (at about 11,500 elevation) we stopped for lunch. 2:45 pm.
