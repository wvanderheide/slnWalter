March 29, 2012 Matt Long and I left Orem at 6:00 am en route to the Henrys Fork trailhead in the High Unitas of Utah.  We arrived at the winter trailhead by 9:40 am, and were snowshoeing with sleds in toe by 10:00 am.  We covered the first 3.3 miles to the summer trailhead in 1.5 hours.  From the summer trailhead we decided to follow the summer trail rather than the frozen creek, a choice which had us pulling sleds across several sections of dirt and rocks.  Once we got off the melted out slopes to consistent snow cover, we found the snow to be basically to soft for snowshoeing.  Due to the mushy conditions it took us 3 hours to cover the approximately 3 miles to the Alligator Lake turn off.  At which point only 2:30 pm, but the going became next to impossible, and we decided to not continue.  Instead we left the sleds at the trail and we took a side trip up to Alligator Lake.  Once we got back from that we decided to camp at the trial junction.  By 5:30 pm we had a camp set up, and were ready to eat dinner.  Before 7pm with the sun still up, we called it a day.

Next morning we were up by 7:30 am,  intend to go a least as far as Elkhorn or possibly Dollar Lake conditions depending.  By 8:30 we set off, and the cold of the night had made the snow okay for snowshoeing.  Within less than a mile we came upon the same abandon camp Wayne, Jake and I had explored back in January.  We had a look  and immediately noticed  the Paris sled and AA batteries we had seen in January were now gone.  We discussed it and decided, the tent was going to rot with the coming warm weather, and things were going to slowly be pilfered over the course of time.   As such we decided to take the best stuff, and do what we could to find out it rightful owner and get it back to him.  I took the tent, air mattress, sleeping pad, crampons and ice axe.  Matt took the sleeping bag and bivy sack.  Once the camp was packed up, we left it behind and continued on to Elkhorn crossing.  

At Elkhorn, I persuaded  Matt to continue to dollar Lake with the option to turn around if the conditions were bad.  Conditions were solid on the wind swept snow between Elkhorn and Dollar Lake.  Even with pausing for lunch we covered the 2.2 miles in around 1.5 hours arriving by 1:00pm.  Just before the lake we crossed the fresh tracks of a bear.

By 2:30 pm we were back at Elkhorn, and back to the soft mushy snow.  We decided to follow the creek back to the abandon camp, instead of our tracks from the morning hoping the snow would be more solid.  Alas the snowshoeing was very difficult.  When we eventually reached the stuff, we loaded it up and continued to our camp.  In the soft snow we again took about 1 hour to cover 1 mile arriving back at camp about 5:45 pm.  Once again we had dinner, and hit the hay around 7pm.

I woke several times in the night, as I was eager to get going in the morning before the snow softened up.  At 5:30 pm I woke Matt up, and by 7:15 am we were packed up and ready to begin the march out.  It was March 31, and Matts thirty first b-day, and I forgot to wish him happy birthday!  I had a much bigger load to pull/or carry out, but the conditions were good, and we drop down to the creek before the windswept dirt sections.  The creek proved to be a wise decision and we reached the summer trailhead in less than 2 hours.  At the summer trailhead we left two notes about the gear we had “found” along with Matt’s email address.  From there we followed the road back to my truck arriving by 10:45 am.

My car was now surround by 14 other vehicles, many belonging to members of the Wasatch Mountain Club who were there for the annual Swanson Brothers Kings Peak in a day trip.  We only pasted three of them en route, and we also saw ski tracks of other the day before.
