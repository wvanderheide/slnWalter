Friday, July 1, 2016.  I hiked up to the 2nd Hamongog from Alpine.  It took just over 2 hours and the first Hamongog is roughly the half-way point.  I arrived around 4:30 pm, and set up a camp.  I even made a fire and roasted some sausage on a stick.  Peter, Ryan, and three of Ryan’s friends (Mitch, Zack, Kilour) were hiking in from Draper to meet me.  I hiked a half mile or so toward their direction to see if I could spot them but I couldn’t.  After I returned to camp I set up a rope for them to follow to my camp, and I put green items on the fire to make it smoke.  When they arrived they noticed the smoke but not the rope.

Next morning I was up with the sun, and once I got my breakfast the others got up.  By 6:45 am we set up to climb Lone Peak.  Part way up Ryan got nausea so him and Peter turned around, but the remaining four of us continued up.  We reached the South Summit by 9:10 am, and the Mitch, Zack and I scrambled over to the true summit which took 10 mins.  

Peter and Ryan went to Hardy Lake instead.  We returned to camp before them around noon.

The others packed up and left before me.  I left around 3pm and it took 2 hours to return to my car.
