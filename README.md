"Walter" is wvanderheide's personal website

Since 1997 I've had a personal website.  It started out as plan HTML, migrated to ASP (VBScript), then ASP.NET (C#).  I am currently redoing it in ASP.Net MVC (C#).  The new MVC version is what is shared on GITHUB.  I added it to GITHUB mostly so I can have it stored some where other than my own box and also so I can take advantage of source code management, and sharing it with myself (mostly, don't think anyone else will be interested in it).
